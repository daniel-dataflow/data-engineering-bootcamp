by succession thine   this were to be new made when thou art old   and see thy blood warm when thou feel st it cold     look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest   now is the time that face

gentle work did frame  the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell  will play the tyrants to the very same   and that unfair which fairly doth excel   for never resting time leads summer on  to hideous

than thou art   if ten of thine ten times refigured thee   then what could death do if thou shouldst depart   leaving thee living in posterity   be not self willed for thou art much too fair   to be death s conquest and make worms thine heir     lo in the orient when the gracious light  lifts up his burning head  each under eye  doth homage to his new appearing sight   serving with looks his sacred majesty     and having climbed the steep up heavenly hill   resembling strong youth in his middle age   yet mortal looks adore his beauty still   attending on his golden pilgrimage   but when from highmost pitch with weary car   like feeble age he reeleth from the day   the eyes  fore duteous  now converted are  from his low tract and look another way   so thou  thy self out going in thy

 or else receiv st with pleasure thine annoy   if the true concord of well tuned sounds   by unions married do offend thine ear   they do but sweetly chide thee  who confounds  in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear     mark how one string sweet husband to another   strikes each in each by mutual ordering   resembling sire  and child  and happy mother   who all in one  one pleasing note do sing   whose speechless song being many  seeming one   sings this to thee   thou single wilt prove none      is it for fear to wet a widow s eye   that thou consum st thy self in single life   ah  if thou issueless shalt hap to die   the world will wail thee like a makeless wife   the world will be thy widow and still weep   that thou no form of thee hast left behind   when every private widow well may keep   by children s eyes  her husband s shape in mind   look what an unthrift in the world doth spend  shifts but his place  for still the world enjoys it   but beauty s waste hath in the world an end   and kept unused the user so destroys it     no love toward others in that bosom sits  that on himself such murd rous shame commits     for shame deny that thou bear st love to any  who for thy self art so unprovident   grant if thou wilt  thou art beloved of many   but that thou none lov st is most evident   for thou art so possessed with murd rous hate   that  gainst thy self thou stick st not to conspire   seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate  which to repair should be thy chief desire   o change thy thought  that i may change my mind   shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love   be as thy presence is gracious and kind   or to thy self at least kind hearted prove   make thee another self for love of me   that beauty still may live in thine or thee       as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow st   in one of thine  from that which thou departest   and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow st   thou mayst call thine  when thou from youth convertest   herein lives wisdom  beauty  and increase   without this folly  age  and cold decay   if all were minded so  the times should cease   and threescore year would make the world away   let those whom nature hath not made for store   harsh  featureless  and rude  barrenly perish   look whom she best endowed  she gave thee more   which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish   she carved thee for her seal  and meant thereby   thou shouldst print more  not let that copy die     when i do count the clock that tells the time   and see the brave day sunk in hideous night   when i behold the violet past prime   and sable curls all silvered o er with white     when lofty trees i see barren of leaves   which erst from heat did canopy the herd  and summer s green all girded up in sheaves  borne on the bier with white and bristly beard   then of thy beauty do i question make  that thou among the wastes of time must go   since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake   and die as fast as they see others grow   and nothing  gainst time s scythe can make defence  save breed to brave him  when he takes thee hence     o that you were your self  but love you are  no longer yours  than you your self here live   against this coming end you should prepare   and your sweet semblance to some other give   so should that beauty which you hold in lease  find no determination  then you were  your self again after your self s decease   when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear     who lets so fair a house fall to decay   which husbandry in honour might uphold   against the stormy gusts of winter s day  and barren rage of death s eternal cold   o none but unthrifts  dear my love you know   you had a father  let your son say so     not from the stars do i my judgement pluck   and yet methinks i have astronomy   but not to tell of good  or evil luck   of plagues  of dearths  or seasons  quality   nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell   pointing to each his thunder  rain and wind   or say with princes if it shall go well  by oft predict that i in heaven find   but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive   and constant stars in them i read such art  as truth and beauty shall together thrive  if from thy self  to store thou wouldst convert     or else of thee this i prognosticate   thy end is truth s and beauty s doom and date     when i consider every thing that grows  holds in perfection but a little moment   that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows  whereon the stars in secret influence comment   when i perceive that men as plants increase   cheered and checked even by the self same sky   vaunt in their youthful sap  at height decrease   and wear their brave state out of memory   then the conceit of this inconstant stay   sets you most rich in youth before my sight   where wasteful time debateth with decay  to change your day of youth to sullied night   and all in war with time for love of you   as he takes from you  i engraft you new       but wherefore do not you a mightier way  make war upon this bloody tyrant time   and fortify your self in your decay  with means more blessed than my barren rhyme   now stand you on the top of happy hours   and many maiden gardens yet unset   with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers   much liker than your painted counterfeit   so should the lines of life that life repair  which this  time s pencil  or my pupil pen  neither in inward worth nor outward fair  can make you live your self in eyes of men   to give away your self  keeps your self still   and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill     who will believe my verse in time to come  if it were filled with your most high deserts   though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb  which hides your life  and shows not half your parts     if i could write the beauty of your eyes   and in fresh numbers number all your graces   the age to come would say this poet lies   such heavenly touches ne er touched earthly faces   so should my papers  yellowed with their age   be scorned  like old men of less truth than tongue   and your true rights be termed a poet s rage   and stretched metre of an antique song   but were some child of yours alive that time   you should live twice in it  and in my rhyme     shall i compare thee to a summer s day   thou art more lovely and more temperate   rough winds do shake the darling buds of may   and summer s lease hath all too short a date   sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines   and often is his gold complexion dimmed   and every fair from fair sometime declines   by chance  or nature s changing course untrimmed     but thy eternal summer shall not fade   nor lose possession of that fair thou ow st   nor shall death brag thou wand rest in his shade   when in eternal lines to time thou grow st   so long as men can breathe or eyes can see   so long lives this  and this gives life to thee     devouring time blunt thou the lion s paws   and make the earth devour her own sweet brood   pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger s jaws   and burn the long lived phoenix  in her blood   make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet st   and do whate er thou wilt swift footed time  to the wide world and all her fading sweets   but i forbid thee one most heinous crime   o carve not with thy hours my love s fair brow   nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen   him in thy course untainted do allow   for beauty s pattern to succeeding men     yet do thy worst old time  despite thy wrong   my love shall in my verse ever live young     a woman s face with nature s own hand painted   hast thou the master mistress of my passion   a woman s gentle heart but not acquainted  with shifting change as is false women s fashion   an eye more bright than theirs  less false in rolling   gilding the object whereupon it gazeth   a man in hue all hues in his controlling   which steals men s eyes and women s souls amazeth   and for a woman wert thou first created   till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting   and by addition me of thee defeated   by adding one thing to my purpose nothing   but since she pricked thee out for women s pleasure   mine be thy love and thy love s use their treasure       so is it not with me as with that muse   stirred by a painted beauty to his verse   who heaven it self for ornament doth use   and every fair with his fair doth rehearse   making a couplement of proud compare  with sun and moon  with earth and sea s rich gems   with april s first born flowers and all things rare   that heaven s air in this huge rondure hems   o let me true in love but truly write   and then believe me  my love is as fair   as any mother s child  though not so bright  as those gold candles fixed in heaven s air   let them say more that like of hearsay well   i will not praise that purpose not to sell     my glass shall not persuade me i am old   so long as youth and thou are of one date   but when in thee time s furrows i behold   then look i death my days should expiate     for all that beauty that doth cover thee   is but the seemly raiment of my heart   which in thy breast doth live  as thine in me   how can i then be elder than thou art   o therefore love be of thyself so wary   as i not for my self  but for thee will   bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary  as tender nurse her babe from faring ill   presume not on thy heart when mine is slain   thou gav st me thine not to give back again     as an unperfect actor on the stage   who with his fear is put beside his part   or some fierce thing replete with too much rage   whose strength s abundance weakens his own heart   so i for fear of trust  forget to say   the perfect ceremony of love s rite   and in mine own love s strength seem to decay   o ercharged with burthen of mine own love s might     o let my looks be then the eloquence   and dumb presagers of my speaking breast   who plead for love  and look for recompense   more than that tongue that more hath more expressed   o learn to read what silent love hath writ   to hear with eyes belongs to love s fine wit     mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled   thy beauty s form in table of my heart   my body is the frame wherein  tis held   and perspective it is best painter s art   for through the painter must you see his skill   to find where your true image pictured lies   which in my bosom s shop is hanging still   that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes   now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done   mine eyes have drawn thy shape  and thine for me  are windows to my breast  where through the sun  delights to peep  to gaze therein on thee     yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art   they draw but what they see  know not the heart     let those who are in favour with their stars   of public honour and proud titles boast   whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars  unlooked for joy in that i honour most   great princes  favourites their fair leaves spread   but as the marigold at the sun s eye   and in themselves their pride lies buried   for at a frown they in their glory die   the painful warrior famoused for fight   after a thousand victories once foiled   is from the book of honour razed quite   and all the rest forgot for which he toiled   then happy i that love and am beloved  where i may not remove nor be removed       lord of my love  to whom in vassalage  thy merit hath my duty strongly knit   to thee i send this written embassage  to witness duty  not to show my wit   duty so great  which wit so poor as mine  may make seem bare  in wanting words to show it   but that i hope some good conceit of thine  in thy soul s thought  all naked  will bestow it   till whatsoever star that guides my moving   points on me graciously with fair aspect   and puts apparel on my tattered loving   to show me worthy of thy sweet respect   then may i dare to boast how i do love thee   till then  not show my head where thou mayst prove me     weary with toil  i haste me to my bed   the dear respose for limbs with travel tired   but then begins a journey in my head  to work my mind  when body s work s expired     for then my thoughts  from far where i abide   intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee   and keep my drooping eyelids open wide   looking on darkness which the blind do see   save that my soul s imaginary sight  presents thy shadow to my sightless view   which like a jewel  hung in ghastly night   makes black night beauteous  and her old face new   lo thus by day my limbs  by night my mind   for thee  and for my self  no quiet find     how can i then return in happy plight  that am debarred the benefit of rest   when day s oppression is not eased by night   but day by night and night by day oppressed   and each  though enemies to either s reign   do in consent shake hands to torture me   the one by toil  the other to complain  how far i toil  still farther off from thee     i tell the day to please him thou art bright   and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven   so flatter i the swart complexioned night   when sparkling stars twire not thou gild st the even   but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer   and night doth nightly make grief s length seem stronger    when in disgrace with fortune and men s eyes   i all alone beweep my outcast state   and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries   and look upon my self and curse my fate   wishing me like to one more rich in hope   featured like him  like him with friends possessed   desiring this man s art  and that man s scope   with what i most enjoy contented least   yet in these thoughts my self almost despising   haply i think on thee  and then my state    like to the lark at break of day arising  from sullen earth  sings hymns at heaven s gate     for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings   that then i scorn to change my state with kings     when to the sessions of sweet silent thought   i summon up remembrance of things past   i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought   and with old woes new wail my dear time s waste   then can i drown an eye  unused to flow   for precious friends hid in death s dateless night   and weep afresh love s long since cancelled woe   and moan th  expense of many a vanished sight   then can i grieve at grievances foregone   and heavily from woe to woe tell o er  the sad account of fore bemoaned moan   which i new pay as if not paid before   but if the while i think on thee  dear friend   all losses are restored  and sorrows end       thy bosom is endeared with all hearts   which i by lacking have supposed dead   and there reigns love and all love s loving parts   and all those friends which i thought buried   how many a holy and obsequious tear  hath dear religious love stol n from mine eye   as interest of the dead  which now appear   but things removed that hidden in thee lie   thou art the grave where buried love doth live   hung with the trophies of my lovers gone   who all their parts of me to thee did give   that due of many  now is thine alone   their images i loved  i view in thee   and thou  all they  hast all the all of me     if thou survive my well contented day   when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover  and shalt by fortune once more re survey  these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover     compare them with the bett ring of the time   and though they be outstripped by every pen   reserve them for my love  not for their rhyme   exceeded by the height of happier men   o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought    had my friend s muse grown with this growing age   a dearer birth than this his love had brought  to march in ranks of better equipage   but since he died and poets better prove   theirs for their style i ll read  his for his love      full many a glorious morning have i seen   flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye   kissing with golden face the meadows green   gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy   anon permit the basest clouds to ride   with ugly rack on his celestial face   and from the forlorn world his visage hide  stealing unseen to west with this disgrace     even so my sun one early morn did shine   with all triumphant splendour on my brow   but out alack  he was but one hour mine   the region cloud hath masked him from me now   yet him for this  my love no whit disdaineth   suns of the world may stain  when heaven s sun staineth     why didst thou promise such a beauteous day   and make me travel forth without my cloak   to let base clouds o ertake me in my way   hiding thy brav ry in their rotten smoke    tis not enough that through the cloud thou break   to dry the rain on my storm beaten face   for no man well of such a salve can speak   that heals the wound  and cures not the disgrace   nor can thy shame give physic to my grief   though thou repent  yet i have still the loss   th  offender s sorrow lends but weak relief  to him that bears the strong offence s cross     ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds   and they are rich  and ransom all ill deeds         no more be grieved at that which thou hast done   roses have thorns  and silver fountains mud   clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun   and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud   all men make faults  and even i in this   authorizing thy trespass with compare   my self corrupting salving thy amiss   excusing thy sins more than thy sins are   for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense   thy adverse party is thy advocate   and  gainst my self a lawful plea commence   such civil war is in my love and hate   that i an accessary needs must be   to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me       let me confess that we two must be twain   although our undivided loves are one   so shall those blots that do with me remain   without thy help  by me be borne alone   in our two loves there is but one respect   though in our lives a separable spite   which though it alter not love s sole effect   yet doth it steal sweet hours from love s delight   i may not evermore acknowledge thee   lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame   nor thou with public kindness honour me   unless thou take that honour from thy name   but do not so  i love thee in such sort   as thou being mine  mine is thy good report     as a decrepit father takes delight   to see his active child do deeds of youth   so i  made lame by fortune s dearest spite  take all my comfort of thy worth and truth     for whether beauty  birth  or wealth  or wit   or any of these all  or all  or more  entitled in thy parts  do crowned sit   i make my love engrafted to this store   so then i am not lame  poor  nor despised   whilst that this shadow doth such substance give   that i in thy abundance am sufficed   and by a part of all thy glory live   look what is best  that best i wish in thee   this wish i have  then ten times happy me     how can my muse want subject to invent  while thou dost breathe that pour st into my verse   thine own sweet argument  too excellent   for every vulgar paper to rehearse   o give thy self the thanks if aught in me   worthy perusal stand against thy sight   for who s so dumb that cannot write to thee   when thou thy self dost give invention light     be thou the tenth muse  ten times more in worth  than those old nine which rhymers invocate   and he that calls on thee  let him bring forth  eternal numbers to outlive long date   if my slight muse do please these curious days   the pain be mine  but thine shall be the praise     o how thy worth with manners may i sing   when thou art all the better part of me   what can mine own praise to mine own self bring   and what is t but mine own when i praise thee   even for this  let us divided live   and our dear love lose name of single one   that by this separation i may give   that due to thee which thou deserv st alone   o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove   were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave   to entertain the time with thoughts of love   which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive     and that thou teachest how to make one twain   by praising him here who doth hence remain     take all my loves  my love  yea take them all   what hast thou then more than thou hadst before   no love  my love  that thou mayst true love call   all mine was thine  before thou hadst this more   then if for my love  thou my love receivest   i cannot blame thee  for my love thou usest   but yet be blamed  if thou thy self deceivest  by wilful taste of what thy self refusest   i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief  although thou steal thee all my poverty   and yet love knows it is a greater grief  to bear greater wrong  than hate s known injury   lascivious grace  in whom all ill well shows   kill me with spites yet we must not be foes       those pretty wrongs that liberty commits   when i am sometime absent from thy heart   thy beauty  and thy years full well befits   for still temptation follows where thou art   gentle thou art  and therefore to be won   beauteous thou art  therefore to be assailed   and when a woman woos  what woman s son   will sourly leave her till he have prevailed   ay me  but yet thou mightst my seat forbear   and chide thy beauty  and thy straying youth   who lead thee in their riot even there  where thou art forced to break a twofold truth   hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee   thine by thy beauty being false to me     that thou hast her it is not all my grief   and yet it may be said i loved her dearly   that she hath thee is of my wailing chief   a loss in love that touches me more nearly     loving offenders thus i will excuse ye   thou dost love her  because thou know st i love her   and for my sake even so doth she abuse me   suff ring my friend for my sake to approve her   if i lose thee  my loss is my love s gain   and losing her  my friend hath found that loss   both find each other  and i lose both twain   and both for my sake lay on me this cross   but here s the joy  my friend and i are one   sweet flattery  then she loves but me alone     when most i wink then do mine eyes best see   for all the day they view things unrespected   but when i sleep  in dreams they look on thee   and darkly bright  are bright in dark directed   then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright  how would thy shadow s form  form happy show   to the clear day with thy much clearer light   when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so     how would  i say  mine eyes be blessed made   by looking on thee in the living day   when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade   through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay   all days are nights to see till i see thee   and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me     if the dull substance of my flesh were thought   injurious distance should not stop my way   for then despite of space i would be brought   from limits far remote  where thou dost stay   no matter then although my foot did stand  upon the farthest earth removed from thee   for nimble thought can jump both sea and land   as soon as think the place where he would be   but ah  thought kills me that i am not thought  to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone   but that so much of earth and water wrought   i must attend  time s leisure with my moan     receiving nought by elements so slow   but heavy tears  badges of either s woe     the other two  slight air  and purging fire   are both with thee  wherever i abide   the first my thought  the other my desire   these present absent with swift motion slide   for when these quicker elements are gone  in tender embassy of love to thee   my life being made of four  with two alone   sinks down to death  oppressed with melancholy   until life s composition be recured   by those swift messengers returned from thee   who even but now come back again assured   of thy fair health  recounting it to me   this told  i joy  but then no longer glad   i send them back again and straight grow sad       mine eye and heart are at a mortal war   how to divide the conquest of thy sight   mine eye  my heart thy picture s sight would bar   my heart  mine eye the freedom of that right   my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie    a closet never pierced with crystal eyes   but the defendant doth that plea deny   and says in him thy fair appearance lies   to side this title is impanelled  a quest of thoughts  all tenants to the heart   and by their verdict is determined  the clear eye s moiety  and the dear heart s part   as thus  mine eye s due is thy outward part   and my heart s right  thy inward love of heart     betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took   and each doth good turns now unto the other   when that mine eye is famished for a look   or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother     with my love s picture then my eye doth feast   and to the painted banquet bids my heart   another time mine eye is my heart s guest   and in his thoughts of love doth share a part   so either by thy picture or my love   thy self away  art present still with me   for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move   and i am still with them  and they with thee   or if they sleep  thy picture in my sight  awakes my heart  to heart s and eye s delight     how careful was i when i took my way   each trifle under truest bars to thrust   that to my use it might unused stay  from hands of falsehood  in sure wards of trust   but thou  to whom my jewels trifles are   most worthy comfort  now my greatest grief   thou best of dearest  and mine only care   art left the prey of every vulgar thief     thee have i not locked up in any chest   save where thou art not  though i feel thou art   within the gentle closure of my breast   from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part   and even thence thou wilt be stol n i fear   for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear     against that time  if ever that time come   when i shall see thee frown on my defects   when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum   called to that audit by advised respects   against that time when thou shalt strangely pass   and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye   when love converted from the thing it was  shall reasons find of settled gravity   against that time do i ensconce me here  within the knowledge of mine own desert   and this my hand  against my self uprear   to guard the lawful reasons on thy part     to leave poor me  thou hast the strength of laws   since why to love  i can allege no cause     how heavy do i journey on the way   when what i seek  my weary travel s end   doth teach that case and that repose to say   thus far the miles are measured from thy friend    the beast that bears me  tired with my woe   plods dully on  to bear that weight in me   as if by some instinct the wretch did know  his rider loved not speed being made from thee   the bloody spur cannot provoke him on   that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide   which heavily he answers with a groan   more sharp to me than spurring to his side   for that same groan doth put this in my mind   my grief lies onward and my joy behind       thus can my love excuse the slow offence   of my dull bearer  when from thee i speed   from where thou art  why should i haste me thence   till i return of posting is no need   o what excuse will my poor beast then find   when swift extremity can seem but slow   then should i spur though mounted on the wind   in winged speed no motion shall i know   then can no horse with my desire keep pace   therefore desire  of perfect st love being made   shall neigh  no dull flesh  in his fiery race   but love  for love  thus shall excuse my jade   since from thee going  he went wilful slow   towards thee i ll run  and give him leave to go     so am i as the rich whose blessed key   can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure   the which he will not every hour survey   for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure     therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare   since seldom coming in that long year set   like stones of worth they thinly placed are   or captain jewels in the carcanet   so is the time that keeps you as my chest  or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide   to make some special instant special blest   by new unfolding his imprisoned pride   blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope   being had to triumph  being lacked to hope     what is your substance  whereof are you made   that millions of strange shadows on you tend   since every one  hath every one  one shade   and you but one  can every shadow lend   describe adonis and the counterfeit   is poorly imitated after you   on helen s cheek all art of beauty set   and you in grecian tires are painted new     speak of the spring  and foison of the year   the one doth shadow of your beauty show   the other as your bounty doth appear   and you in every blessed shape we know   in all external grace you have some part   but you like none  none you for constant heart     o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem   by that sweet ornament which truth doth give   the rose looks fair  but fairer we it deem  for that sweet odour  which doth in it live   the canker blooms have full as deep a dye   as the perfumed tincture of the roses   hang on such thorns  and play as wantonly   when summer s breath their masked buds discloses   but for their virtue only is their show   they live unwooed  and unrespected fade   die to themselves  sweet roses do not so   of their sweet deaths  are sweetest odours made     and so of you  beauteous and lovely youth   when that shall vade  by verse distills your truth     not marble  nor the gilded monuments  of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme   but you shall shine more bright in these contents  than unswept stone  besmeared with sluttish time   when wasteful war shall statues overturn   and broils root out the work of masonry   nor mars his sword  nor war s quick fire shall burn   the living record of your memory    gainst death  and all oblivious enmity  shall you pace forth  your praise shall still find room   even in the eyes of all posterity  that wear this world out to the ending doom   so till the judgment that your self arise   you live in this  and dwell in lovers  eyes       sweet love renew thy force  be it not said  thy edge should blunter be than appetite   which but to day by feeding is allayed   to morrow sharpened in his former might   so love be thou  although to day thou fill  thy hungry eyes  even till they wink with fulness   to morrow see again  and do not kill  the spirit of love  with a perpetual dulness   let this sad interim like the ocean be  which parts the shore  where two contracted new   come daily to the banks  that when they see   return of love  more blest may be the view   or call it winter  which being full of care   makes summer s welcome  thrice more wished  more rare     being your slave what should i do but tend   upon the hours  and times of your desire   i have no precious time at all to spend   nor services to do till you require     nor dare i chide the world without end hour   whilst i  my sovereign  watch the clock for you   nor think the bitterness of absence sour   when you have bid your servant once adieu   nor dare i question with my jealous thought   where you may be  or your affairs suppose   but like a sad slave stay and think of nought  save where you are  how happy you make those   so true a fool is love  that in your will    though you do any thing  he thinks no ill     that god forbid  that made me first your slave   i should in thought control your times of pleasure   or at your hand th  account of hours to crave   being your vassal bound to stay your leisure   o let me suffer  being at your beck   th  imprisoned absence of your liberty   and patience tame to sufferance bide each check   without accusing you of injury     be where you list  your charter is so strong   that you your self may privilage your time  to what you will  to you it doth belong   your self to pardon of self doing crime   i am to wait  though waiting so be hell   not blame your pleasure be it ill or well     if there be nothing new  but that which is   hath been before  how are our brains beguiled   which labouring for invention bear amis  the second burthen of a former child   o that record could with a backward look   even of five hundred courses of the sun   show me your image in some antique book   since mind at first in character was done   that i might see what the old world could say   to this composed wonder of your frame   whether we are mended  or whether better they   or whether revolution be the same     o sure i am the wits of former days   to subjects worse have given admiring praise     like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore   so do our minutes hasten to their end   each changing place with that which goes before   in sequent toil all forwards do contend   nativity once in the main of light   crawls to maturity  wherewith being crowned   crooked eclipses  gainst his glory fight   and time that gave  doth now his gift confound   time doth transfix the flourish set on youth   and delves the parallels in beauty s brow   feeds on the rarities of nature s truth   and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow   and yet to times in hope  my verse shall stand  praising thy worth  despite his cruel hand       is it thy will  thy image should keep open  my heavy eyelids to the weary night   dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken   while shadows like to thee do mock my sight   is it thy spirit that thou send st from thee  so far from home into my deeds to pry   to find out shames and idle hours in me   the scope and tenure of thy jealousy   o no  thy love though much  is not so great   it is my love that keeps mine eye awake   mine own true love that doth my rest defeat   to play the watchman ever for thy sake   for thee watch i  whilst thou dost wake elsewhere   from me far off  with others all too near     sin of self love possesseth all mine eye   and all my soul  and all my every part   and for this sin there is no remedy   it is so grounded inward in my heart     methinks no face so gracious is as mine   no shape so true  no truth of such account   and for my self mine own worth do define   as i all other in all worths surmount   but when my glass shows me my self indeed  beated and chopt with tanned antiquity   mine own self love quite contrary i read   self  so self loving were iniquity    tis thee  my self  that for my self i praise   painting my age with beauty of thy days     against my love shall be as i am now  with time s injurious hand crushed and o erworn   when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow  with lines and wrinkles  when his youthful morn  hath travelled on to age s steepy night   and all those beauties whereof now he s king  are vanishing  or vanished out of sight   stealing away the treasure of his spring     for such a time do i now fortify  against confounding age s cruel knife   that he shall never cut from memory  my sweet love s beauty  though my lover s life   his beauty shall in these black lines be seen   and they shall live  and he in them still green     when i have seen by time s fell hand defaced  the rich proud cost of outworn buried age   when sometime lofty towers i see down rased   and brass eternal slave to mortal rage   when i have seen the hungry ocean gain  advantage on the kingdom of the shore   and the firm soil win of the watery main   increasing store with loss  and loss with store   when i have seen such interchange of state   or state it self confounded  to decay   ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate  that time will come and take my love away     this thought is as a death which cannot choose  but weep to have  that which it fears to lose     since brass  nor stone  nor earth  nor boundless sea   but sad mortality o ersways their power   how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea   whose action is no stronger than a flower   o how shall summer s honey breath hold out   against the wrackful siege of batt ring days   when rocks impregnable are not so stout   nor gates of steel so strong but time decays   o fearful meditation  where alack   shall time s best jewel from time s chest lie hid   or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back   or who his spoil of beauty can forbid   o none  unless this miracle have might   that in black ink my love may still shine bright       tired with all these for restful death i cry   as to behold desert a beggar born   and needy nothing trimmed in jollity   and purest faith unhappily forsworn   and gilded honour shamefully misplaced   and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted   and right perfection wrongfully disgraced   and strength by limping sway disabled  and art made tongue tied by authority   and folly  doctor like  controlling skill   and simple truth miscalled simplicity   and captive good attending captain ill   tired with all these  from these would i be gone   save that to die  i leave my love alone     ah wherefore with infection should he live   and with his presence grace impiety   that sin by him advantage should achieve   and lace it self with his society     why should false painting imitate his cheek   and steal dead seeming of his living hue   why should poor beauty indirectly seek   roses of shadow  since his rose is true   why should he live  now nature bankrupt is   beggared of blood to blush through lively veins   for she hath no exchequer now but his   and proud of many  lives upon his gains   o him she stores  to show what wealth she had   in days long since  before these last so bad     thus is his cheek the map of days outworn   when beauty lived and died as flowers do now   before these bastard signs of fair were born   or durst inhabit on a living brow   before the golden tresses of the dead   the right of sepulchres  were shorn away   to live a second life on second head   ere beauty s dead fleece made another gay     in him those holy antique hours are seen   without all ornament  it self and true   making no summer of another s green   robbing no old to dress his beauty new   and him as for a map doth nature store   to show false art what beauty was of yore     those parts of thee that the world s eye doth view   want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend   all tongues  the voice of souls  give thee that due   uttering bare truth  even so as foes commend   thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned   but those same tongues that give thee so thine own   in other accents do this praise confound  by seeing farther than the eye hath shown   they look into the beauty of thy mind   and that in guess they measure by thy deeds   then churls their thoughts  although their eyes were kind   to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds     but why thy odour matcheth not thy show   the soil is this  that thou dost common grow         that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect   for slander s mark was ever yet the fair   the ornament of beauty is suspect   a crow that flies in heaven s sweetest air   so thou be good  slander doth but approve   thy worth the greater being wooed of time   for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love   and thou present st a pure unstained prime   thou hast passed by the ambush of young days   either not assailed  or victor being charged   yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise   to tie up envy  evermore enlarged   if some suspect of ill masked not thy show   then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe           no longer mourn for me when i am dead   than you shall hear the surly sullen bell  give warning to the world that i am fled  from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell   nay if you read this line  remember not   the hand that writ it  for i love you so   that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot   if thinking on me then should make you woe   o if  i say  you look upon this verse   when i  perhaps  compounded am with clay   do not so much as my poor name rehearse   but let your love even with my life decay   lest the wise world should look into your moan   and mock you with me after i am gone         o lest the world should task you to recite   what merit lived in me that you should love  after my death  dear love  forget me quite   for you in me can nothing worthy prove     unless you would devise some virtuous lie   to do more for me than mine own desert   and hang more praise upon deceased i   than niggard truth would willingly impart   o lest your true love may seem false in this   that you for love speak well of me untrue   my name be buried where my body is   and live no more to shame nor me  nor you   for i am shamed by that which i bring forth   and so should you  to love things nothing worth         that time of year thou mayst in me behold   when yellow leaves  or none  or few do hang  upon those boughs which shake against the cold   bare ruined choirs  where late the sweet birds sang   in me thou seest the twilight of such day   as after sunset fadeth in the west   which by and by black night doth take away   death s second self that seals up all in rest     in me thou seest the glowing of such fire   that on the ashes of his youth doth lie   as the death bed  whereon it must expire   consumed with that which it was nourished by   this thou perceiv st  which makes thy love more strong   to love that well  which thou must leave ere long         but be contented when that fell arrest   without all bail shall carry me away   my life hath in this line some interest   which for memorial still with thee shall stay   when thou reviewest this  thou dost review   the very part was consecrate to thee   the earth can have but earth  which is his due   my spirit is thine the better part of me   so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life   the prey of worms  my body being dead   the coward conquest of a wretch s knife   too base of thee to be remembered     the worth of that  is that which it contains   and that is this  and this with thee remains         so are you to my thoughts as food to life   or as sweet seasoned showers are to the ground   and for the peace of you i hold such strife  as  twixt a miser and his wealth is found   now proud as an enjoyer  and anon  doubting the filching age will steal his treasure   now counting best to be with you alone   then bettered that the world may see my pleasure   sometime all full with feasting on your sight   and by and by clean starved for a look   possessing or pursuing no delight  save what is had  or must from you be took   thus do i pine and surfeit day by day   or gluttoning on all  or all away           why is my verse so barren of new pride   so far from variation or quick change   why with the time do i not glance aside  to new found methods  and to compounds strange   why write i still all one  ever the same   and keep invention in a noted weed   that every word doth almost tell my name   showing their birth  and where they did proceed   o know sweet love i always write of you   and you and love are still my argument   so all my best is dressing old words new   spending again what is already spent   for as the sun is daily new and old   so is my love still telling what is told         thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear   thy dial how thy precious minutes waste   these vacant leaves thy mind s imprint will bear   and of this book  this learning mayst thou taste     the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show   of mouthed graves will give thee memory   thou by thy dial s shady stealth mayst know   time s thievish progress to eternity   look what thy memory cannot contain   commit to these waste blanks  and thou shalt find  those children nursed  delivered from thy brain   to take a new acquaintance of thy mind   these offices  so oft as thou wilt look   shall profit thee  and much enrich thy book         so oft have i invoked thee for my muse   and found such fair assistance in my verse   as every alien pen hath got my use   and under thee their poesy disperse   thine eyes  that taught the dumb on high to sing   and heavy ignorance aloft to fly   have added feathers to the learned s wing   and given grace a double majesty   yet be most proud of that which i compile   whose influence is thine  and born of thee   in others  works thou dost but mend the style   and arts with thy sweet graces graced be   but thou art all my art  and dost advance  as high as learning  my rude ignorance         whilst i alone did call upon thy aid   my verse alone had all thy gentle grace   but now my gracious numbers are decayed   and my sick muse doth give an other place   i grant  sweet love  thy lovely argument  deserves the travail of a worthier pen   yet what of thee thy poet doth invent   he robs thee of  and pays it thee again   he lends thee virtue  and he stole that word   from thy behaviour  beauty doth he give  and found it in thy cheek  he can afford  no praise to thee  but what in thee doth live     then thank him not for that which he doth say   since what he owes thee  thou thy self dost pay         o how i faint when i of you do write   knowing a better spirit doth use your name   and in the praise thereof spends all his might   to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame   but since your worth  wide as the ocean is   the humble as the proudest sail doth bear   my saucy bark  inferior far to his   on your broad main doth wilfully appear   your shallowest help will hold me up afloat   whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride   or  being wrecked  i am a worthless boat   he of tall building  and of goodly pride   then if he thrive and i be cast away   the worst was this  my love was my decay           or i shall live your epitaph to make   or you survive when i in earth am rotten   from hence your memory death cannot take   although in me each part will be forgotten   your name from hence immortal life shall have   though i  once gone  to all the world must die   the earth can yield me but a common grave   when you entombed in men s eyes shall lie   your monument shall be my gentle verse   which eyes not yet created shall o er read   and tongues to be  your being shall rehearse   when all the breathers of this world are dead   you still shall live  such virtue hath my pen   where breath most breathes  even in the mouths of men         i grant thou wert not married to my muse   and therefore mayst without attaint o erlook  the dedicated words which writers use  of their fair subject  blessing every book     thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue   finding thy worth a limit past my praise   and therefore art enforced to seek anew   some fresher stamp of the time bettering days   and do so love  yet when they have devised   what strained touches rhetoric can lend   thou truly fair  wert truly sympathized   in true plain words  by thy true telling friend   and their gross painting might be better used   where cheeks need blood  in thee it is abused         i never saw that you did painting need   and therefore to your fair no painting set   i found  or thought i found  you did exceed   that barren tender of a poet s debt   and therefore have i slept in your report   that you your self being extant well might show   how far a modern quill doth come too short   speaking of worth  what worth in you doth grow     this silence for my sin you did impute   which shall be most my glory being dumb   for i impair not beauty being mute   when others would give life  and bring a tomb   there lives more life in one of your fair eyes   than both your poets can in praise devise         who is it that says most  which can say more   than this rich praise  that you alone  are you   in whose confine immured is the store   which should example where your equal grew   lean penury within that pen doth dwell   that to his subject lends not some small glory   but he that writes of you  if he can tell   that you are you  so dignifies his story   let him but copy what in you is writ   not making worse what nature made so clear   and such a counterpart shall fame his wit   making his style admired every where     you to your beauteous blessings add a curse   being fond on praise  which makes your praises worse         my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still   while comments of your praise richly compiled   reserve their character with golden quill   and precious phrase by all the muses filed   i think good thoughts  whilst other write good words   and like unlettered clerk still cry amen   to every hymn that able spirit affords   in polished form of well refined pen   hearing you praised  i say  tis so   tis true   and to the most of praise add something more   but that is in my thought  whose love to you   though words come hindmost  holds his rank before   then others  for the breath of words respect   me for my dumb thoughts  speaking in effect           was it the proud full sail of his great verse   bound for the prize of  all too precious  you   that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse   making their tomb the womb wherein they grew   was it his spirit  by spirits taught to write   above a mortal pitch  that struck me dead   no  neither he  nor his compeers by night  giving him aid  my verse astonished   he nor that affable familiar ghost  which nightly gulls him with intelligence   as victors of my silence cannot boast   i was not sick of any fear from thence   but when your countenance filled up his line   then lacked i matter  that enfeebled mine         farewell  thou art too dear for my possessing   and like enough thou know st thy estimate   the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing   my bonds in thee are all determinate     for how do i hold thee but by thy granting   and for that riches where is my deserving   the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting   and so my patent back again is swerving   thy self thou gav st  thy own worth then not knowing   or me to whom thou gav st it  else mistaking   so thy great gift upon misprision growing   comes home again  on better judgement making   thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter   in sleep a king  but waking no such matter         when thou shalt be disposed to set me light   and place my merit in the eye of scorn   upon thy side  against my self i ll fight   and prove thee virtuous  though thou art forsworn   with mine own weakness being best acquainted   upon thy part i can set down a story  of faults concealed  wherein i am attainted   that thou in losing me  shalt win much glory     and i by this will be a gainer too   for bending all my loving thoughts on thee   the injuries that to my self i do   doing thee vantage  double vantage me   such is my love  to thee i so belong   that for thy right  my self will bear all wrong         say that thou didst forsake me for some fault   and i will comment upon that offence   speak of my lameness  and i straight will halt   against thy reasons making no defence   thou canst not  love  disgrace me half so ill   to set a form upon desired change   as i ll my self disgrace  knowing thy will   i will acquaintance strangle and look strange   be absent from thy walks and in my tongue   thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell   lest i  too much profane  should do it wronk   and haply of our old acquaintance tell     for thee  against my self i ll vow debate   for i must ne er love him whom thou dost hate         then hate me when thou wilt  if ever  now   now while the world is bent my deeds to cross   join with the spite of fortune  make me bow   and do not drop in for an after loss   ah do not  when my heart hath  scaped this sorrow   come in the rearward of a conquered woe   give not a windy night a rainy morrow   to linger out a purposed overthrow   if thou wilt leave me  do not leave me last   when other petty griefs have done their spite   but in the onset come  so shall i taste  at first the very worst of fortune s might   and other strains of woe  which now seem woe   compared with loss of thee  will not seem so           some glory in their birth  some in their skill   some in their wealth  some in their body s force   some in their garments though new fangled ill   some in their hawks and hounds  some in their horse   and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure   wherein it finds a joy above the rest   but these particulars are not my measure   all these i better in one general best   thy love is better than high birth to me   richer than wealth  prouder than garments  costs   of more delight than hawks and horses be   and having thee  of all men s pride i boast   wretched in this alone  that thou mayst take   all this away  and me most wretchcd make         but do thy worst to steal thy self away   for term of life thou art assured mine   and life no longer than thy love will stay   for it depends upon that love of thine     then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs   when in the least of them my life hath end   i see  a better state to me belongs  than that  which on thy humour doth depend   thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind   since that my life on thy revolt doth lie   o what a happy title do i find   happy to have thy love  happy to die   but what s so blessed fair that fears no blot   thou mayst be false  and yet i know it not         so shall i live  supposing thou art true   like a deceived husband  so love s face   may still seem love to me  though altered new   thy looks with me  thy heart in other place   for there can live no hatred in thine eye   therefore in that i cannot know thy change   in many s looks  the false heart s history  is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange     but heaven in thy creation did decree   that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell   whate er thy thoughts  or thy heart s workings be   thy looks should nothing thence  but sweetness tell   how like eve s apple doth thy beauty grow   if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show         they that have power to hurt  and will do none   that do not do the thing  they most do show   who moving others  are themselves as stone   unmoved  cold  and to temptation slow   they rightly do inherit heaven s graces   and husband nature s riches from expense   tibey are the lords and owners of their faces   others  but stewards of their excellence   the summer s flower is to the summer sweet   though to it self  it only live and die   but if that flower with base infection meet   the basest weed outbraves his dignity     for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds   lilies that fester  smell far worse than weeds         how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame   which like a canker in the fragrant rose   doth spot the beauty of thy budding name   o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose   that tongue that tells the story of thy days    making lascivious comments on thy sport   cannot dispraise  but in a kind of praise   naming thy name  blesses an ill report   o what a mansion have those vices got   which for their habitation chose out thee   where beauty s veil doth cover every blot   and all things turns to fair  that eyes can see   take heed  dear heart  of this large privilege   the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge           some say thy fault is youth  some wantonness   some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport   both grace and faults are loved of more and less   thou mak st faults graces  that to thee resort   as on the finger of a throned queen   the basest jewel will be well esteemed   so are those errors that in thee are seen   to truths translated  and for true things deemed   how many lambs might the stern wolf betray   if like a lamb he could his looks translate   how many gazers mightst thou lead away   if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state   but do not so  i love thee in such sort   as thou being mine  mine is thy good report         how like a winter hath my absence been  from thee  the pleasure of the fleeting year   what freezings have i felt  what dark days seen   what old december s bareness everywhere     and yet this time removed was summer s time   the teeming autumn big with rich increase   bearing the wanton burden of the prime   like widowed wombs after their lords  decease   yet this abundant issue seemed to me  but hope of orphans  and unfathered fruit   for summer and his pleasures wait on thee   and thou away  the very birds are mute   or if they sing   tis with so dull a cheer   that leaves look pale  dreading the winter s near         from you have i been absent in the spring   when proud pied april  dressed in all his trim   hath put a spirit of youth in every thing   that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him   yet nor the lays of birds  nor the sweet smell  of different flowers in odour and in hue   could make me any summer s story tell   or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew     nor did i wonder at the lily s white   nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose   they were but sweet  but figures of delight   drawn after you  you pattern of all those   yet seemed it winter still  and you away   as with your shadow i with these did play         the forward violet thus did i chide   sweet thief  whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells   if not from my love s breath  the purple pride  which on thy soft check for complexion dwells   in my love s veins thou hast too grossly dyed   the lily i condemned for thy hand   and buds of marjoram had stol n thy hair   the roses fearfully on thorns did stand   one blushing shame  another white despair   a third nor red  nor white  had stol n of both   and to his robbery had annexed thy breath   but for his theft in pride of all his growth    a vengeful canker eat him up to death   more flowers i noted  yet i none could see   but sweet  or colour it had stol n from thee         where art thou muse that thou forget st so long   to speak of that which gives thee all thy might   spend st thou thy fury on some worthless song   darkening thy power to lend base subjects light   return forgetful muse  and straight redeem   in gentle numbers time so idly spent   sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem   and gives thy pen both skill and argument   rise resty muse  my love s sweet face survey   if time have any wrinkle graven there   if any  be a satire to decay   and make time s spoils despised everywhere   give my love fame faster than time wastes life   so thou prevent st his scythe  and crooked knife         o truant muse what shall be thy amends   for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed   both truth and beauty on my love depends   so dost thou too  and therein dignified   make answer muse  wilt thou not haply say    truth needs no colour with his colour fixed   beauty no pencil  beauty s truth to lay   but best is best  if never intermixed    because he needs no praise  wilt thou be dumb   excuse not silence so  for t lies in thee   to make him much outlive a gilded tomb   and to be praised of ages yet to be   then do thy office muse  i teach thee how   to make him seem long hence  as he shows now         my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming   i love not less  though less the show appear   that love is merchandized  whose rich esteeming     the owner s tongue doth publish every where   our love was new  and then but in the spring   when i was wont to greet it with my lays   as philomel in summer s front doth sing   and stops her pipe in growth of riper days   not that the summer is less pleasant now  than when her mournful hymns did hush the night   but that wild music burthens every bough   and sweets grown common lose their dear delight   therefore like her  i sometime hold my tongue   because i would not dull you with my song         alack what poverty my muse brings forth   that having such a scope to show her pride   the argument all bare is of more worth  than when it hath my added praise beside   o blame me not if i no more can write   look in your glass and there appears a face   that over goes my blunt invention quite     dulling my lines  and doing me disgrace   were it not sinful then striving to mend   to mar the subject that before was well   for to no other pass my verses tend   than of your graces and your gifts to tell   and more  much more than in my verse can sit   your own glass shows you  when you look in it         to me fair friend you never can be old   for as you were when first your eye i eyed   such seems your beauty still  three winters cold   have from the forests shook three summers  pride   three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned   in process of the seasons have i seen   three april perfumes in three hot junes burned   since first i saw you fresh which yet are green   ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand   steal from his figure  and no pace perceived   so your sweet hue  which methinks still doth stand    hath motion  and mine eye may be deceived   for fear of which  hear this thou age unbred   ere you were born was beauty s summer dead         let not my love be called idolatry   nor my beloved as an idol show   since all alike my songs and praises be  to one  of one  still such  and ever so   kind is my love to day  to morrow kind   still constant in a wondrous excellence   therefore my verse to constancy confined   one thing expressing  leaves out difference   fair  kind  and true  is all my argument   fair  kind  and true  varying to other words   and in this change is my invention spent   three themes in one  which wondrous scope affords   fair  kind  and true  have often lived alone   which three till now  never kept seat in one         when in the chronicle of wasted time   i see descriptions of the fairest wights   and beauty making beautiful old rhyme   in praise of ladies dead  and lovely knights   then in the blazon of sweet beauty s best   of hand  of foot  of lip  of eye  of brow   i see their antique pen would have expressed   even such a beauty as you master now   so all their praises are but prophecies  of this our time  all you prefiguring   and for they looked but with divining eyes   they had not skill enough your worth to sing   for we which now behold these present days   have eyes to wonder  but lack tongues to praise         not mine own fears  nor the prophetic soul   of the wide world  dreaming on things to come   can yet the lease of my true love control     supposed as forfeit to a confined doom   the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured   and the sad augurs mock their own presage   incertainties now crown themselves assured   and peace proclaims olives of endless age   now with the drops of this most balmy time   my love looks fresh  and death to me subscribes   since spite of him i ll live in this poor rhyme   while he insults o er dull and speechless tribes   and thou in this shalt find thy monument   when tyrants  crests and tombs of brass are spent         what s in the brain that ink may character   which hath not figured to thee my true spirit   what s new to speak  what now to register   that may express my love  or thy dear merit   nothing sweet boy  but yet like prayers divine   i must each day say o er the very same   counting no old thing old  thou mine  i thine     even as when first i hallowed thy fair name   so that eternal love in love s fresh case   weighs not the dust and injury of age   nor gives to necessary wrinkles place   but makes antiquity for aye his page   finding the first conceit of love there bred   where time and outward form would show it dead         o never say that i was false of heart   though absence seemed my flame to qualify   as easy might i from my self depart   as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie   that is my home of love  if i have ranged   like him that travels i return again   just to the time  not with the time exchanged   so that my self bring water for my stain   never believe though in my nature reigned   all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood   that it could so preposterously be stained     to leave for nothing all thy sum of good   for nothing this wide universe i call   save thou my rose  in it thou art my all         alas  tis true  i have gone here and there   and made my self a motley to the view   gored mine own thoughts  sold cheap what is most dear   made old offences of affections new   most true it is  that i have looked on truth  askance and strangely  but by all above   these blenches gave my heart another youth   and worse essays proved thee my best of love   now all is done  have what shall have no end   mine appetite i never more will grind  on newer proof  to try an older friend   a god in love  to whom i am confined   then give me welcome  next my heaven the best   even to thy pure and most most loving breast         o for my sake do you with fortune chide   the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds   that did not better for my life provide   than public means which public manners breeds   thence comes it that my name receives a brand   and almost thence my nature is subdued  to what it works in  like the dyer s hand   pity me then  and wish i were renewed   whilst like a willing patient i will drink   potions of eisel  gainst my strong infection   no bitterness that i will bitter think   nor double penance to correct correction   pity me then dear friend  and i assure ye   even that your pity is enough to cure me         your love and pity doth th  impression fill   which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow   for what care i who calls me well or ill     so you o er green my bad  my good allow   you are my all the world  and i must strive   to know my shames and praises from your tongue   none else to me  nor i to none alive   that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong   in so profound abysm i throw all care  of others  voices  that my adder s sense   to critic and to flatterer stopped are   mark how with my neglect i do dispense   you are so strongly in my purpose bred   that all the world besides methinks are dead         since i left you  mine eye is in my mind   and that which governs me to go about   doth part his function  and is partly blind   seems seeing  but effectually is out   for it no form delivers to the heart  of bird  of flower  or shape which it doth latch   of his quick objects hath the mind no part     nor his own vision holds what it doth catch   for if it see the rud st or gentlest sight   the most sweet favour or deformed st creature   the mountain  or the sea  the day  or night   the crow  or dove  it shapes them to your feature   incapable of more  replete with you   my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue         or whether doth my mind being crowned with you  drink up the monarch s plague this flattery   or whether shall i say mine eye saith true   and that your love taught it this alchemy   to make of monsters  and things indigest   such cherubins as your sweet self resemble   creating every bad a perfect best  as fast as objects to his beams assemble   o  tis the first   tis flattery in my seeing   and my great mind most kingly drinks it up   mine eye well knows what with his gust is  greeing     and to his palate doth prepare the cup   if it be poisoned   tis the lesser sin   that mine eye loves it and doth first begin         those lines that i before have writ do lie   even those that said i could not love you dearer   yet then my judgment knew no reason why   my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer   but reckoning time  whose millioned accidents  creep in  twixt vows  and change decrees of kings   tan sacred beauty  blunt the sharp st intents   divert strong minds to the course of alt ring things   alas why fearing of time s tyranny   might i not then say  now i love you best    when i was certain o er incertainty   crowning the present  doubting of the rest   love is a babe  then might i not say so  to give full growth to that which still doth grow         let me not to the marriage of true minds  admit impediments  love is not love  which alters when it alteration finds   or bends with the remover to remove   o no  it is an ever fixed mark  that looks on tempests and is never shaken   it is the star to every wand ring bark   whose worth s unknown  although his height be taken   love s not time s fool  though rosy lips and cheeks  within his bending sickle s compass come   love alters not with his brief hours and weeks   but bears it out even to the edge of doom   if this be error and upon me proved   i never writ  nor no man ever loved         accuse me thus  that i have scanted all   wherein i should your great deserts repay   forgot upon your dearest love to call     whereto all bonds do tie me day by day   that i have frequent been with unknown minds   and given to time your own dear purchased right   that i have hoisted sail to all the winds  which should transport me farthest from your sight   book both my wilfulness and errors down   and on just proof surmise  accumulate   bring me within the level of your frown   but shoot not at me in your wakened hate   since my appeal says i did strive to prove  the constancy and virtue of your love         like as to make our appetite more keen  with eager compounds we our palate urge   as to prevent our maladies unseen   we sicken to shun sickness when we purge   even so being full of your ne er cloying sweetness   to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding   and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness     to be diseased ere that there was true needing   thus policy in love t  anticipate  the ills that were not  grew to faults assured   and brought to medicine a healthful state  which rank of goodness would by ill be cured   but thence i learn and find the lesson true   drugs poison him that so feil sick of you         what potions have i drunk of siren tears  distilled from limbecks foul as hell within   applying fears to hopes  and hopes to fears   still losing when i saw my self to win   what wretched errors hath my heart committed   whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never   how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted  in the distraction of this madding fever   o benefit of ill  now i find true  that better is  by evil still made better   and ruined love when it is built anew    grows fairer than at first  more strong  far greater   so i return rebuked to my content   and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent         that you were once unkind befriends me now   and for that sorrow  which i then did feel   needs must i under my transgression bow   unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel   for if you were by my unkindness shaken  as i by yours  y have passed a hell of time   and i a tyrant have no leisure taken  to weigh how once i suffered in your crime   o that our night of woe might have remembered  my deepest sense  how hard true sorrow hits   and soon to you  as you to me then tendered  the humble salve  which wounded bosoms fits   but that your trespass now becomes a fee   mine ransoms yours  and yours must ransom me          tis better to be vile than vile esteemed   when not to be  receives reproach of being   and the just pleasure lost  which is so deemed   not by our feeling  but by others  seeing   for why should others  false adulterate eyes  give salutation to my sportive blood   or on my frailties why are frailer spies   which in their wills count bad what i think good   no  i am that i am  and they that level  at my abuses  reckon up their own   i may be straight though they themselves be bevel   by their rank thoughts  my deeds must not be shown  unless this general evil they maintain   all men are bad and in their badness reign         thy gift  thy tables  are within my brain  full charactered with lasting memory   which shall above that idle rank remain    beyond all date even to eternity   or at the least  so long as brain and heart  have faculty by nature to subsist   till each to razed oblivion yield his part  of thee  thy record never can be missed   that poor retention could not so much hold   nor need i tallies thy dear love to score   therefore to give them from me was i bold   to trust those tables that receive thee more   to keep an adjunct to remember thee  were to import forgetfulness in me         no  time  thou shalt not boast that i do change   thy pyramids built up with newer might  to me are nothing novel  nothing strange   they are but dressings of a former sight   our dates are brief  and therefore we admire   what thou dost foist upon us that is old   and rather make them born to our desire     than think that we before have heard them told   thy registers and thee i both defy   not wond ring at the present  nor the past   for thy records  and what we see doth lie   made more or less by thy continual haste   this i do vow and this shall ever be   i will be true despite thy scythe and thee         if my dear love were but the child of state   it might for fortune s bastard be unfathered   as subject to time s love or to time s hate   weeds among weeds  or flowers with flowers gathered   no it was builded far from accident   it suffers not in smiling pomp  nor falls  under the blow of thralled discontent   whereto th  inviting time our fashion calls   it fears not policy that heretic   which works on leases of short numbered hours   but all alone stands hugely politic     that it nor grows with heat  nor drowns with showers   to this i witness call the fools of time   which die for goodness  who have lived for crime         were t aught to me i bore the canopy   with my extern the outward honouring   or laid great bases for eternity   which proves more short than waste or ruining   have i not seen dwellers on form and favour  lose all  and more by paying too much rent  for compound sweet  forgoing simple savour   pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent   no  let me be obsequious in thy heart   and take thou my oblation  poor but free   which is not mixed with seconds  knows no art   but mutual render  only me for thee   hence  thou suborned informer  a true soul  when most impeached  stands least in thy control         o thou my lovely boy who in thy power   dost hold time s fickle glass his fickle hour   who hast by waning grown  and therein show st   thy lovers withering  as thy sweet self grow st   if nature  sovereign mistress over wrack   as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back   she keeps thee to this purpose  that her skill  may time disgrace  and wretched minutes kill   yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure   she may detain  but not still keep her treasure   her audit  though delayed  answered must be   and her quietus is to render thee         in the old age black was not counted fair   or if it were it bore not beauty s name   but now is black beauty s successive heir   and beauty slandered with a bastard shame   for since each hand hath put on nature s power     fairing the foul with art s false borrowed face   sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower   but is profaned  if not lives in disgrace   therefore my mistress  eyes are raven black   her eyes so suited  and they mourners seem   at such who not born fair no beauty lack   slandering creation with a false esteem   yet so they mourn becoming of their woe   that every tongue says beauty should look so         how oft when thou  my music  music play st   upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds  with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway st  the wiry concord that mine ear confounds   do i envy those jacks that nimble leap   to kiss the tender inward of thy hand   whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap   at the wood s boldness by thee blushing stand   to be so tickled they would change their state    and situation with those dancing chips   o er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait   making dead wood more blest than living lips   since saucy jacks so happy are in this   give them thy fingers  me thy lips to kiss         th  expense of spirit in a waste of shame  is lust in action  and till action  lust  is perjured  murd rous  bloody full of blame   savage  extreme  rude  cruel  not to trust   enjoyed no sooner but despised straight   past reason hunted  and no sooner had  past reason hated as a swallowed bait   on purpose laid to make the taker mad   mad in pursuit and in possession so   had  having  and in quest  to have extreme   a bliss in proof and proved  a very woe   before a joy proposed behind a dream   all this the world well knows yet none knows well     to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell         my mistress  eyes are nothing like the sun   coral is far more red  than her lips red   if snow be white  why then her breasts are dun   if hairs be wires  black wires grow on her head   i have seen roses damasked  red and white   but no such roses see i in her cheeks   and in some perfumes is there more delight   than in the breath that from my mistress reeks   i love to hear her speak  yet well i know   that music hath a far more pleasing sound   i grant i never saw a goddess go   my mistress when she walks treads on the ground   and yet by heaven i think my love as rare   as any she belied with false compare         thou art as tyrannous  so as thou art     as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel   for well thou know st to my dear doting heart  thou art the fairest and most precious jewel   yet in good faith some say that thee behold   thy face hath not the power to make love groan   to say they err  i dare not be so bold   although i swear it to my self alone   and to be sure that is not false i swear   a thousand groans but thinking on thy face   one on another s neck do witness bear  thy black is fairest in my judgment s place   in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds   and thence this slander as i think proceeds         thine eyes i love  and they as pitying me   knowing thy heart torment me with disdain   have put on black  and loving mourners be   looking with pretty ruth upon my pain   and truly not the morning sun of heaven    better becomes the grey cheeks of the east   nor that full star that ushers in the even  doth half that glory to the sober west  as those two mourning eyes become thy face   o let it then as well beseem thy heart  to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace   and suit thy pity like in every part   then will i swear beauty herself is black   and all they foul that thy complexion lack         beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan  for that deep wound it gives my friend and me   is t not enough to torture me alone   but slave to slavery my sweet st friend must be   me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken   and my next self thou harder hast engrossed   of him  my self  and thee i am forsaken   a torment thrice three fold thus to be crossed   prison my heart in thy steel bosom s ward     but then my friend s heart let my poor heart bail   whoe er keeps me  let my heart be his guard   thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol   and yet thou wilt  for i being pent in thee   perforce am thine and all that is in me         so now i have confessed that he is thine   and i my self am mortgaged to thy will   my self i ll forfeit  so that other mine   thou wilt restore to be my comfort still   but thou wilt not  nor he will not be free   for thou art covetous  and he is kind   he learned but surety like to write for me   under that bond that him as fist doth bind   the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take   thou usurer that put st forth all to use   and sue a friend  came debtor for my sake   so him i lose through my unkind abuse   him have i lost  thou hast both him and me     he pays the whole  and yet am i not free         whoever hath her wish  thou hast thy will   and  will  to boot  and  will  in over plus   more than enough am i that vex thee still   to thy sweet will making addition thus   wilt thou whose will is large and spacious   not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine   shall will in others seem right gracious   and in my will no fair acceptance shine   the sea all water  yet receives rain still   and in abundance addeth to his store   so thou being rich in will add to thy will  one will of mine to make thy large will more   let no unkind  no fair beseechers kill   think all but one  and me in that one  will          if thy soul check thee that i come so near     swear to thy blind soul that i was thy  will    and will thy soul knows is admitted there   thus far for love  my love suit sweet fulfil    will   will fulfil the treasure of thy love   ay  fill it full with wills  and my will one   in things of great receipt with case we prove   among a number one is reckoned none   then in the number let me pass untold   though in thy store s account i one must be   for nothing hold me  so it please thee hold   that nothing me  a something sweet to thee   make but my name thy love  and love that still   and then thou lov st me for my name is will         thou blind fool love  what dost thou to mine eyes   that they behold and see not what they see   they know what beauty is  see where it lies   yet what the best is  take the worst to be   if eyes corrupt by over partial looks     be anchored in the bay where all men ride   why of eyes  falsehood hast thou forged hooks   whereto the judgment of my heart is tied   why should my heart think that a several plot   which my heart knows the wide world s common place   or mine eyes seeing this  say this is not  to put fair truth upon so foul a face   in things right true my heart and eyes have erred   and to this false plague are they now transferred         when my love swears that she is made of truth   i do believe her though i know she lies   that she might think me some untutored youth   unlearned in the world s false subtleties   thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young   although she knows my days are past the best   simply i credit her false speaking tongue   on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed   but wherefore says she not she is unjust     and wherefore say not i that i am old   o love s best habit is in seeming trust   and age in love  loves not to have years told   therefore i lie with her  and she with me   and in our faults by lies we flattered be         o call not me to justify the wrong   that thy unkindness lays upon my heart   wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue   use power with power  and slay me not by art   tell me thou lov st elsewhere  but in my sight   dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside   what need st thou wound with cunning when thy might  is more than my o erpressed defence can bide   let me excuse thee  ah my love well knows   her pretty looks have been mine enemies   and therefore from my face she turns my foes   that they elsewhere might dart their injuries   yet do not so  but since i am near slain     kill me outright with looks  and rid my pain         be wise as thou art cruel  do not press  my tongue tied patience with too much disdain   lest sorrow lend me words and words express   the manner of my pity wanting pain   if i might teach thee wit better it were   though not to love  yet love to tell me so   as testy sick men when their deaths be near   no news but health from their physicians know   for if i should despair i should grow mad   and in my madness might speak ill of thee   now this ill wresting world is grown so bad   mad slanderers by mad ears believed be   that i may not be so  nor thou belied   bear thine eyes straight  though thy proud heart go wide         in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes     for they in thee a thousand errors note   but  tis my heart that loves what they despise   who in despite of view is pleased to dote   nor are mine cars with thy tongue s tune delighted   nor tender feeling to base touches prone   nor taste  nor smell  desire to be invited  to any sensual feast with thee alone   but my five wits  nor my five senses can  dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee   who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man   thy proud heart s slave and vassal wretch to be   only my plague thus far i count my gain   that she that makes me sin  awards me pain         love is my sin  and thy dear virtue hate   hate of my sin  grounded on sinful loving   o but with mine  compare thou thine own state   and thou shalt find it merits not reproving   or if it do  not from those lips of thine     that have profaned their scarlet ornaments   and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine   robbed others  beds  revenues of their rents   be it lawful i love thee as thou lov st those   whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee   root pity in thy heart that when it grows   thy pity may deserve to pitied be   if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide   by self example mayst thou be denied         lo as a careful huswife runs to catch   one of her feathered creatures broke away   sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch  in pursuit of the thing she would have stay   whilst her neglected child holds her in chase   cries to catch her whose busy care is bent   to follow that which flies before her face   not prizing her poor infant s discontent   so run st thou after that which flies from thee     whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind   but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me   and play the mother s part  kiss me  be kind   so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will   if thou turn back and my loud crying still         two loves i have of comfort and despair   which like two spirits do suggest me still   the better angel is a man right fair   the worser spirit a woman coloured ill   to win me soon to hell my female evil   tempteth my better angel from my side   and would corrupt my saint to be a devil   wooing his purity with her foul pride   and whether that my angel be turned fiend   suspect i may  yet not directly tell   but being both from me both to each friend   i guess one angel in another s hell   yet this shall i ne er know but live in doubt     till my bad angel fire my good one out         those lips that love s own hand did make   breathed forth the sound that said  i hate    to me that languished for her sake   but when she saw my woeful state   straight in her heart did mercy come   chiding that tongue that ever sweet   was used in giving gentle doom   and taught it thus anew to greet    i hate  she altered with an end   that followed it as gentle day   doth follow night who like a fiend  from heaven to hell is flown away    i hate   from hate away she threw   and saved my life saying  not you      poor soul the centre of my sinful earth     my sinful earth these rebel powers array   why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth  painting thy outward walls so costly gay   why so large cost having so short a lease   dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend   shall worms inheritors of this excess  eat up thy charge  is this thy body s end   then soul live thou upon thy servant s loss   and let that pine to aggravate thy store   buy terms divine in selling hours of dross   within be fed  without be rich no more   so shall thou feed on death  that feeds on men   and death once dead  there s no more dying then     my love is as a fever longing still   for that which longer nurseth the disease   feeding on that which doth preserve the ill   th  uncertain sickly appetite to please   my reason the physician to my love     angry that his prescriptions are not kept  hath left me  and i desperate now approve   desire is death  which physic did except   past cure i am  now reason is past care   and frantic mad with evermore unrest   my thoughts and my discourse as mad men s are   at random from the truth vainly expressed   for i have sworn thee fair  and thought thee bright   who art as black as hell  as dark as night     o me  what eyes hath love put in my head   which have no correspondence with true sight   or if they have  where is my judgment fled   that censures falsely what they see aright   if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote   what means the world to say it is not so   if it be not  then love doth well denote   love s eye is not so true as all men s  no   how can it  o how can love s eye be true     that is so vexed with watching and with tears   no marvel then though i mistake my view   the sun it self sees not  till heaven clears   o cunning love  with tears thou keep st me blind   lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find     canst thou o cruel  say i love thee not   when i against my self with thee partake   do i not think on thee when i forgot  am of my self  all tyrant  for thy sake   who hateth thee that i do call my friend   on whom frown st thou that i do fawn upon   nay if thou lour st on me do i not spend  revenge upon my self with present moan   what merit do i in my self respect   that is so proud thy service to despise   when all my best doth worship thy defect   commanded by the motion of thine eyes   but love hate on for now i know thy mind     those that can see thou lov st  and i am blind     o from what power hast thou this powerful might   with insufficiency my heart to sway   to make me give the lie to my true sight   and swear that brightness doth not grace the day   whence hast thou this becoming of things ill   that in the very refuse of thy deeds   there is such strength and warrantise of skill   that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds   who taught thee how to make me love thee more   the more i hear and see just cause of hate   o though i love what others do abhor   with others thou shouldst not abhor my state   if thy unworthiness raised love in me   more worthy i to be beloved of thee     love is too young to know what conscience is     yet who knows not conscience is born of love   then gentle cheater urge not my amiss   lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove   for thou betraying me  i do betray  my nobler part to my gross body s treason   my soul doth tell my body that he may   triumph in love  flesh stays no farther reason   but rising at thy name doth point out thee   as his triumphant prize  proud of this pride   he is contented thy poor drudge to be   to stand in thy affairs  fall by thy side   no want of conscience hold it that i call   her love  for whose dear love i rise and fall     in loving thee thou know st i am forsworn   but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing   in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn   in vowing new hate after new love bearing   but why of two oaths  breach do i accuse thee     when i break twenty  i am perjured most   for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee   and all my honest faith in thee is lost   for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness   oaths of thy love  thy truth  thy constancy   and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness   or made them swear against the thing they see   for i have sworn thee fair  more perjured i   to swear against the truth so foul a be     cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep   a maid of dian s this advantage found   and his love kindling fire did quickly steep  in a cold valley fountain of that ground   which borrowed from this holy fire of love   a dateless lively heat still to endure   and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove   against strange maladies a sovereign cure   but at my mistress  eye love s brand new fired     the boy for trial needs would touch my breast   i sick withal the help of bath desired   and thither hied a sad distempered guest   but found no cure  the bath for my help lies   where cupid got new fire  my mistress  eyes     the little love god lying once asleep   laid by his side his heart inflaming brand   whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep   came tripping by  but in her maiden hand   the fairest votary took up that fire   which many legions of true hearts had warmed   and so the general of hot desire   was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed   this brand she quenched in a cool well by   which from love s fire took heat perpetual   growing a bath and healthful remedy   for men discased  but i my mistress  thrall   came there for cure and this by that i prove     love s fire heats water  water cools not love                       the end'"
