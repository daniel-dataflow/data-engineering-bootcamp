       "\"the sonnets  by william shakespeare  from fairest creatures we desire increase, that thereby beauty's rose might never die, but as the riper should by time decease, his tender heir might bear his memory: but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, making a famine where abundance lies, thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, and only herald to the gaudy spring, within thine own bud buriest thy content, and tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding: pity the world, or else this glutton be, to eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.  when forty winters shall besiege thy brow, and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now, will be a tattered weed of small worth held:   then being asked, where all thy beauty lies, where all the treasure of thy lusty days; to say within thine own deep sunken eyes, were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise. how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use, if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine shall sum my count, and make my old excuse' proving his beauty by succession thine. this were to be new made when thou art old, and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.  look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest, now is the time that face should form another, whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. for where is she so fair whose uneared womb disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? or who is he so fond will be the tomb, of his self-love to stop posterity?   thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee calls back the lovely april of her prime, so thou through windows of thine age shalt see, despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. but if thou live remembered not to be, die single and thine image dies with thee.  unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend, upon thy self thy beauty's legacy? nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend, and being frank she lends to those are free: then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse, the bounteous largess given thee to give? profitless usurer why dost thou use so great a sum of sums yet canst not live? for having traffic with thy self alone, thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive, then how when nature calls thee to be gone, what acceptable audit canst thou leave?   thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee, which used lives th' executor to be.  those hours that with gentle work did frame the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell will play the tyrants to the very same, and that unfair which fairly doth excel: for never-resting time leads summer on to hideous winter and confounds him there, sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where: then were not summer's distillation left a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, beauty's effect with beauty were bereft, nor it nor no remembrance what it was. but flowers distilled though they with winter meet, leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.    then let not winter's ragged hand deface, in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled: make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place, with beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed: that use is not forbidden usury, which happies those that pay the willing loan; that's for thy self to breed another thee, or ten times happier be it ten for one, ten times thy self were happier than thou art, if ten of thine ten times refigured thee: then what could death do if thou shouldst depart, leaving thee living in posterity? be not self-willed for thou art much too fair, to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.  lo in the orient when the gracious light lifts up his burning head, each under eye doth homage to his new-appearing sight, serving with looks his sacred majesty,   and having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill, resembling strong youth in his middle age, yet mortal looks adore his beauty still, attending on his golden pilgrimage: but when from highmost pitch with weary car, like feeble age he reeleth from the day, the eyes (fore duteous) now converted are from his low tract and look another way: so thou, thy self out-going in thy noon: unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.  music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly? sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy: why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly, or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy? if the true concord of well-tuned sounds, by unions married do offend thine ear, they do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:   mark how one string sweet husband to another, strikes each in each by mutual ordering; resembling sire, and child, and happy mother, who all in one, one pleasing note do sing: whose speechless song being many, seeming one, sings this to thee, 'thou single wilt prove none'.  is it for fear to wet a widow's eye, that thou consum'st thy self in single life? ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die, the world will wail thee like a makeless wife, the world will be thy widow and still weep, that thou no form of thee hast left behind, when every private widow well may keep, by children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind: look what an unthrift in the world doth spend shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it; but beauty's waste hath in the world an end, and kept unused the user so destroys it:   no love toward others in that bosom sits that on himself such murd'rous shame commits.  for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any who for thy self art so unprovident. grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many, but that thou none lov'st is most evident: for thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate, that 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire, seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire: o change thy thought, that i may change my mind, shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love? be as thy presence is gracious and kind, or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove, make thee another self for love of me, that beauty still may live in thine or thee.    as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st, in one of thine, from that which thou departest, and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st, thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest, herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase, without this folly, age, and cold decay, if all were minded so, the times should cease, and threescore year would make the world away: let those whom nature hath not made for store, harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish: look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more; which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish: she carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby, thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.  when i do count the clock that tells the time, and see the brave day sunk in hideous night, when i behold the violet past prime, and sable curls all silvered o'er with white:   when lofty trees i see barren of leaves, which erst from heat did canopy the herd and summer's green all girded up in sheaves borne on the bier with white and bristly beard: then of thy beauty do i question make that thou among the wastes of time must go, since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake, and die as fast as they see others grow, and nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.  o that you were your self, but love you are no longer yours, than you your self here live, against this coming end you should prepare, and your sweet semblance to some other give. so should that beauty which you hold in lease find no determination, then you were your self again after your self's decease, when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.   who lets so fair a house fall to decay, which husbandry in honour might uphold, against the stormy gusts of winter's day and barren rage of death's eternal cold? o none but unthrifts, dear my love you know, you had a father, let your son say so.  not from the stars do i my judgement pluck, and yet methinks i have astronomy, but not to tell of good, or evil luck, of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality, nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell; pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind, or say with princes if it shall go well by oft predict that i in heaven find. but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive, and constant stars in them i read such art as truth and beauty shall together thrive if from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:   or else of thee this i prognosticate, thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.  when i consider every thing that grows holds in perfection but a little moment. that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment. when i perceive that men as plants increase, cheered and checked even by the self-same sky: vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease, and wear their brave state out of memory. then the conceit of this inconstant stay, sets you most rich in youth before my sight, where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night, and all in war with time for love of you, as he takes from you, i engraft you new.    but wherefore do not you a mightier way make war upon this bloody tyrant time? and fortify your self in your decay with means more blessed than my barren rhyme? now stand you on the top of happy hours, and many maiden gardens yet unset, with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers, much liker than your painted counterfeit: so should the lines of life that life repair which this (time's pencil) or my pupil pen neither in inward worth nor outward fair can make you live your self in eyes of men. to give away your self, keeps your self still, and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.  who will believe my verse in time to come if it were filled with your most high deserts? though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:   if i could write the beauty of your eyes, and in fresh numbers number all your graces, the age to come would say this poet lies, such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces. so should my papers (yellowed with their age) be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue, and your true rights be termed a poet's rage, and stretched metre of an antique song. but were some child of yours alive that time, you should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.  shall i compare thee to a summer's day? thou art more lovely and more temperate: rough winds do shake the darling buds of may, and summer's lease hath all too short a date: sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, and often is his gold complexion dimmed, and every fair from fair sometime declines, by chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:   but thy eternal summer shall not fade, nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st, nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st, so long as men can breathe or eyes can see, so long lives this, and this gives life to thee.  devouring time blunt thou the lion's paws, and make the earth devour her own sweet brood, pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws, and burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood, make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st, and do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed time to the wide world and all her fading sweets: but i forbid thee one most heinous crime, o carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow, nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen, him in thy course untainted do allow, for beauty's pattern to succeeding men.   yet do thy worst old time: despite thy wrong, my love shall in my verse ever live young.  a woman's face with nature's own hand painted, hast thou the master mistress of my passion, a woman's gentle heart but not acquainted with shifting change as is false women's fashion, an eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling: gilding the object whereupon it gazeth, a man in hue all hues in his controlling, which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth. and for a woman wert thou first created, till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting, and by addition me of thee defeated, by adding one thing to my purpose nothing. but since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure, mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.    so is it not with me as with that muse, stirred by a painted beauty to his verse, who heaven it self for ornament doth use, and every fair with his fair doth rehearse, making a couplement of proud compare with sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems: with april's first-born flowers and all things rare, that heaven's air in this huge rondure hems. o let me true in love but truly write, and then believe me, my love is as fair, as any mother's child, though not so bright as those gold candles fixed in heaven's air: let them say more that like of hearsay well, i will not praise that purpose not to sell.  my glass shall not persuade me i am old, so long as youth and thou are of one date, but when in thee time's furrows i behold, then look i death my days should expiate.   for all that beauty that doth cover thee, is but the seemly raiment of my heart, which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me, how can i then be elder than thou art? o therefore love be of thyself so wary, as i not for my self, but for thee will, bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary as tender nurse her babe from faring ill. presume not on thy heart when mine is slain, thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.  as an unperfect actor on the stage, who with his fear is put beside his part, or some fierce thing replete with too much rage, whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart; so i for fear of trust, forget to say, the perfect ceremony of love's rite, and in mine own love's strength seem to decay, o'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:   o let my looks be then the eloquence, and dumb presagers of my speaking breast, who plead for love, and look for recompense, more than that tongue that more hath more expressed. o learn to read what silent love hath writ, to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.  mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled, thy beauty's form in table of my heart, my body is the frame wherein 'tis held, and perspective it is best painter's art. for through the painter must you see his skill, to find where your true image pictured lies, which in my bosom's shop is hanging still, that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes: now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done, mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me are windows to my breast, where-through the sun delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;   yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art, they draw but what they see, know not the heart.  let those who are in favour with their stars, of public honour and proud titles boast, whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars unlooked for joy in that i honour most; great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread, but as the marigold at the sun's eye, and in themselves their pride lies buried, for at a frown they in their glory die. the painful warrior famoused for fight, after a thousand victories once foiled, is from the book of honour razed quite, and all the rest forgot for which he toiled: then happy i that love and am beloved where i may not remove nor be removed.    lord of my love, to whom in vassalage thy merit hath my duty strongly knit; to thee i send this written embassage to witness duty, not to show my wit. duty so great, which wit so poor as mine may make seem bare, in wanting words to show it; but that i hope some good conceit of thine in thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it: till whatsoever star that guides my moving, points on me graciously with fair aspect, and puts apparel on my tattered loving, to show me worthy of thy sweet respect, then may i dare to boast how i do love thee, till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.  weary with toil, i haste me to my bed, the dear respose for limbs with travel tired, but then begins a journey in my head to work my mind, when body's work's expired.   for then my thoughts (from far where i abide) intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee, and keep my drooping eyelids open wide, looking on darkness which the blind do see. save that my soul's imaginary sight presents thy shadow to my sightless view, which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night) makes black night beauteous, and her old face new. lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind, for thee, and for my self, no quiet find.  how can i then return in happy plight that am debarred the benefit of rest? when day's oppression is not eased by night, but day by night and night by day oppressed. and each (though enemies to either's reign) do in consent shake hands to torture me, the one by toil, the other to complain how far i toil, still farther off from thee.   i tell the day to please him thou art bright, and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven: so flatter i the swart-complexioned night, when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even. but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer, and night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger  when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, i all alone beweep my outcast state, and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, and look upon my self and curse my fate, wishing me like to one more rich in hope, featured like him, like him with friends possessed, desiring this man's art, and that man's scope, with what i most enjoy contented least, yet in these thoughts my self almost despising, haply i think on thee, and then my state, (like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,   for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings, that then i scorn to change my state with kings.  when to the sessions of sweet silent thought, i summon up remembrance of things past, i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought, and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste: then can i drown an eye (unused to flow) for precious friends hid in death's dateless night, and weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe, and moan th' expense of many a vanished sight. then can i grieve at grievances foregone, and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er the sad account of fore-bemoaned moan, which i new pay as if not paid before. but if the while i think on thee (dear friend) all losses are restored, and sorrows end.    thy bosom is endeared with all hearts, which i by lacking have supposed dead, and there reigns love and all love's loving parts, and all those friends which i thought buried. how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye, as interest of the dead, which now appear, but things removed that hidden in thee lie. thou art the grave where buried love doth live, hung with the trophies of my lovers gone, who all their parts of me to thee did give, that due of many, now is thine alone. their images i loved, i view in thee, and thou (all they) hast all the all of me.  if thou survive my well-contented day, when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more re-survey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:   compare them with the bett'ring of the time, and though they be outstripped by every pen, reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme, exceeded by the height of happier men. o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought, 'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age, a dearer birth than this his love had brought to march in ranks of better equipage: but since he died and poets better prove, theirs for their style i'll read, his for his love'.  full many a glorious morning have i seen, flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, kissing with golden face the meadows green; gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy: anon permit the basest clouds to ride, with ugly rack on his celestial face, and from the forlorn world his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:   even so my sun one early morn did shine, with all triumphant splendour on my brow, but out alack, he was but one hour mine, the region cloud hath masked him from me now. yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth, suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth.  why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, and make me travel forth without my cloak, to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way, hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke? 'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break, to dry the rain on my storm-beaten face, for no man well of such a salve can speak, that heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace: nor can thy shame give physic to my grief, though thou repent, yet i have still the loss, th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offence's cross.   ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds, and they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.    no more be grieved at that which thou hast done, roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud, clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. all men make faults, and even i in this, authorizing thy trespass with compare, my self corrupting salving thy amiss, excusing thy sins more than thy sins are: for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense, thy adverse party is thy advocate, and 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence: such civil war is in my love and hate, that i an accessary needs must be, to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.    let me confess that we two must be twain, although our undivided loves are one: so shall those blots that do with me remain, without thy help, by me be borne alone. in our two loves there is but one respect, though in our lives a separable spite, which though it alter not love's sole effect, yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight. i may not evermore acknowledge thee, lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame, nor thou with public kindness honour me, unless thou take that honour from thy name: but do not so, i love thee in such sort, as thou being mine, mine is thy good report.  as a decrepit father takes delight, to see his active child do deeds of youth, so i, made lame by fortune's dearest spite take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.   for whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, or any of these all, or all, or more entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit, i make my love engrafted to this store: so then i am not lame, poor, nor despised, whilst that this shadow doth such substance give, that i in thy abundance am sufficed, and by a part of all thy glory live: look what is best, that best i wish in thee, this wish i have, then ten times happy me.  how can my muse want subject to invent while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse, thine own sweet argument, too excellent, for every vulgar paper to rehearse? o give thy self the thanks if aught in me, worthy perusal stand against thy sight, for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee, when thou thy self dost give invention light?   be thou the tenth muse, ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate, and he that calls on thee, let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date. if my slight muse do please these curious days, the pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.  o how thy worth with manners may i sing, when thou art all the better part of me? what can mine own praise to mine own self bring: and what is't but mine own when i praise thee? even for this, let us divided live, and our dear love lose name of single one, that by this separation i may give: that due to thee which thou deserv'st alone: o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove, were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave, to entertain the time with thoughts of love, which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.   and that thou teachest how to make one twain, by praising him here who doth hence remain.  take all my loves, my love, yea take them all, what hast thou then more than thou hadst before? no love, my love, that thou mayst true love call, all mine was thine, before thou hadst this more: then if for my love, thou my love receivest, i cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest, but yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest by wilful taste of what thy self refusest. i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief although thou steal thee all my poverty: and yet love knows it is a greater grief to bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury. lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows, kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.    those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, when i am sometime absent from thy heart, thy beauty, and thy years full well befits, for still temptation follows where thou art. gentle thou art, and therefore to be won, beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed. and when a woman woos, what woman's son, will sourly leave her till he have prevailed? ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear, and chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth, who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth: hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee, thine by thy beauty being false to me.  that thou hast her it is not all my grief, and yet it may be said i loved her dearly, that she hath thee is of my wailing chief, a loss in love that touches me more nearly.   loving offenders thus i will excuse ye, thou dost love her, because thou know'st i love her, and for my sake even so doth she abuse me, suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her. if i lose thee, my loss is my love's gain, and losing her, my friend hath found that loss, both find each other, and i lose both twain, and both for my sake lay on me this cross, but here's the joy, my friend and i are one, sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.  when most i wink then do mine eyes best see, for all the day they view things unrespected, but when i sleep, in dreams they look on thee, and darkly bright, are bright in dark directed. then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright how would thy shadow's form, form happy show, to the clear day with thy much clearer light, when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!   how would (i say) mine eyes be blessed made, by looking on thee in the living day, when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade, through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay! all days are nights to see till i see thee, and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.  if the dull substance of my flesh were thought, injurious distance should not stop my way, for then despite of space i would be brought, from limits far remote, where thou dost stay, no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removed from thee, for nimble thought can jump both sea and land, as soon as think the place where he would be. but ah, thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, but that so much of earth and water wrought, i must attend, time's leisure with my moan.   receiving nought by elements so slow, but heavy tears, badges of either's woe.  the other two, slight air, and purging fire, are both with thee, wherever i abide, the first my thought, the other my desire, these present-absent with swift motion slide. for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee, my life being made of four, with two alone, sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy. until life's composition be recured, by those swift messengers returned from thee, who even but now come back again assured, of thy fair health, recounting it to me. this told, i joy, but then no longer glad, i send them back again and straight grow sad.    mine eye and heart are at a mortal war, how to divide the conquest of thy sight, mine eye, my heart thy picture's sight would bar, my heart, mine eye the freedom of that right, my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie, (a closet never pierced with crystal eyes) but the defendant doth that plea deny, and says in him thy fair appearance lies. to side this title is impanelled a quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, and by their verdict is determined the clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part. as thus, mine eye's due is thy outward part, and my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.  betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took, and each doth good turns now unto the other, when that mine eye is famished for a look, or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;   with my love's picture then my eye doth feast, and to the painted banquet bids my heart: another time mine eye is my heart's guest, and in his thoughts of love doth share a part. so either by thy picture or my love, thy self away, art present still with me, for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move, and i am still with them, and they with thee. or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.  how careful was i when i took my way, each trifle under truest bars to thrust, that to my use it might unused stay from hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust! but thou, to whom my jewels trifles are, most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief, thou best of dearest, and mine only care, art left the prey of every vulgar thief.   thee have i not locked up in any chest, save where thou art not, though i feel thou art, within the gentle closure of my breast, from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part, and even thence thou wilt be stol'n i fear, for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.  against that time (if ever that time come) when i shall see thee frown on my defects, when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum, called to that audit by advised respects, against that time when thou shalt strangely pass, and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye, when love converted from the thing it was shall reasons find of settled gravity; against that time do i ensconce me here within the knowledge of mine own desert, and this my hand, against my self uprear, to guard the lawful reasons on thy part,   to leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws, since why to love, i can allege no cause.  how heavy do i journey on the way, when what i seek (my weary travel's end) doth teach that case and that repose to say 'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.' the beast that bears me, tired with my woe, plods dully on, to bear that weight in me, as if by some instinct the wretch did know his rider loved not speed being made from thee: the bloody spur cannot provoke him on, that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide, which heavily he answers with a groan, more sharp to me than spurring to his side, for that same groan doth put this in my mind, my grief lies onward and my joy behind.    thus can my love excuse the slow offence, of my dull bearer, when from thee i speed, from where thou art, why should i haste me thence? till i return of posting is no need. o what excuse will my poor beast then find, when swift extremity can seem but slow? then should i spur though mounted on the wind, in winged speed no motion shall i know, then can no horse with my desire keep pace, therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made) shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race, but love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade, since from thee going, he went wilful-slow, towards thee i'll run, and give him leave to go.  so am i as the rich whose blessed key, can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure, the which he will not every hour survey, for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.   therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare, since seldom coming in that long year set, like stones of worth they thinly placed are, or captain jewels in the carcanet. so is the time that keeps you as my chest or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, to make some special instant special-blest, by new unfolding his imprisoned pride. blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope, being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.  what is your substance, whereof are you made, that millions of strange shadows on you tend? since every one, hath every one, one shade, and you but one, can every shadow lend: describe adonis and the counterfeit, is poorly imitated after you, on helen's cheek all art of beauty set, and you in grecian tires are painted new:   speak of the spring, and foison of the year, the one doth shadow of your beauty show, the other as your bounty doth appear, and you in every blessed shape we know. in all external grace you have some part, but you like none, none you for constant heart.  o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem, by that sweet ornament which truth doth give! the rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem for that sweet odour, which doth in it live: the canker blooms have full as deep a dye, as the perfumed tincture of the roses, hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly, when summer's breath their masked buds discloses: but for their virtue only is their show, they live unwooed, and unrespected fade, die to themselves. sweet roses do not so, of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:   and so of you, beauteous and lovely youth, when that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.  not marble, nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme, but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time. when wasteful war shall statues overturn, and broils root out the work of masonry, nor mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn: the living record of your memory. 'gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room, even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom. so till the judgment that your self arise, you live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.    sweet love renew thy force, be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite, which but to-day by feeding is allayed, to-morrow sharpened in his former might. so love be thou, although to-day thou fill thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness, to-morrow see again, and do not kill the spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness: let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore, where two contracted new, come daily to the banks, that when they see: return of love, more blest may be the view. or call it winter, which being full of care, makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.  being your slave what should i do but tend, upon the hours, and times of your desire? i have no precious time at all to spend; nor services to do till you require.   nor dare i chide the world-without-end hour, whilst i (my sovereign) watch the clock for you, nor think the bitterness of absence sour, when you have bid your servant once adieu. nor dare i question with my jealous thought, where you may be, or your affairs suppose, but like a sad slave stay and think of nought save where you are, how happy you make those. so true a fool is love, that in your will, (though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.  that god forbid, that made me first your slave, i should in thought control your times of pleasure, or at your hand th' account of hours to crave, being your vassal bound to stay your leisure. o let me suffer (being at your beck) th' imprisoned absence of your liberty, and patience tame to sufferance bide each check, without accusing you of injury.   be where you list, your charter is so strong, that you your self may privilage your time to what you will, to you it doth belong, your self to pardon of self-doing crime. i am to wait, though waiting so be hell, not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.  if there be nothing new, but that which is, hath been before, how are our brains beguiled, which labouring for invention bear amis the second burthen of a former child! o that record could with a backward look, even of five hundred courses of the sun, show me your image in some antique book, since mind at first in character was done. that i might see what the old world could say, to this composed wonder of your frame, whether we are mended, or whether better they, or whether revolution be the same.   o sure i am the wits of former days, to subjects worse have given admiring praise.  like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, so do our minutes hasten to their end, each changing place with that which goes before, in sequent toil all forwards do contend. nativity once in the main of light, crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned, crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight, and time that gave, doth now his gift confound. time doth transfix the flourish set on youth, and delves the parallels in beauty's brow, feeds on the rarities of nature's truth, and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow. and yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.    is it thy will, thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night? dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken, while shadows like to thee do mock my sight? is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry, to find out shames and idle hours in me, the scope and tenure of thy jealousy? o no, thy love though much, is not so great, it is my love that keeps mine eye awake, mine own true love that doth my rest defeat, to play the watchman ever for thy sake. for thee watch i, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere, from me far off, with others all too near.  sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye, and all my soul, and all my every part; and for this sin there is no remedy, it is so grounded inward in my heart.   methinks no face so gracious is as mine, no shape so true, no truth of such account, and for my self mine own worth do define, as i all other in all worths surmount. but when my glass shows me my self indeed beated and chopt with tanned antiquity, mine own self-love quite contrary i read: self, so self-loving were iniquity. 'tis thee (my self) that for my self i praise, painting my age with beauty of thy days.  against my love shall be as i am now with time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn, when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow with lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn hath travelled on to age's steepy night, and all those beauties whereof now he's king are vanishing, or vanished out of sight, stealing away the treasure of his spring:   for such a time do i now fortify against confounding age's cruel knife, that he shall never cut from memory my sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life. his beauty shall in these black lines be seen, and they shall live, and he in them still green.  when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced the rich-proud cost of outworn buried age, when sometime lofty towers i see down-rased, and brass eternal slave to mortal rage. when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore, and the firm soil win of the watery main, increasing store with loss, and loss with store. when i have seen such interchange of state, or state it self confounded, to decay, ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away.   this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have, that which it fears to lose.  since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, but sad mortality o'ersways their power, how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, whose action is no stronger than a flower? o how shall summer's honey breath hold out, against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days, when rocks impregnable are not so stout, nor gates of steel so strong but time decays? o fearful meditation, where alack, shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid? or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back, or who his spoil of beauty can forbid? o none, unless this miracle have might, that in black ink my love may still shine bright.    tired with all these for restful death i cry, as to behold desert a beggar born, and needy nothing trimmed in jollity, and purest faith unhappily forsworn, and gilded honour shamefully misplaced, and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted, and right perfection wrongfully disgraced, and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tongue-tied by authority, and folly (doctor-like) controlling skill, and simple truth miscalled simplicity, and captive good attending captain ill. tired with all these, from these would i be gone, save that to die, i leave my love alone.  ah wherefore with infection should he live, and with his presence grace impiety, that sin by him advantage should achieve, and lace it self with his society?   why should false painting imitate his cheek, and steal dead seeming of his living hue? why should poor beauty indirectly seek, roses of shadow, since his rose is true? why should he live, now nature bankrupt is, beggared of blood to blush through lively veins, for she hath no exchequer now but his, and proud of many, lives upon his gains? o him she stores, to show what wealth she had, in days long since, before these last so bad.  thus is his cheek the map of days outworn, when beauty lived and died as flowers do now, before these bastard signs of fair were born, or durst inhabit on a living brow: before the golden tresses of the dead, the right of sepulchres, were shorn away, to live a second life on second head, ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:   in him those holy antique hours are seen, without all ornament, it self and true, making no summer of another's green, robbing no old to dress his beauty new, and him as for a map doth nature store, to show false art what beauty was of yore.  those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view, want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend: all tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due, uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend. thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned, but those same tongues that give thee so thine own, in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown. they look into the beauty of thy mind, and that in guess they measure by thy deeds, then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind) to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:   but why thy odour matcheth not thy show, the soil is this, that thou dost common grow.    that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect, for slander's mark was ever yet the fair, the ornament of beauty is suspect, a crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air. so thou be good, slander doth but approve, thy worth the greater being wooed of time, for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love, and thou present'st a pure unstained prime. thou hast passed by the ambush of young days, either not assailed, or victor being charged, yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise, to tie up envy, evermore enlarged, if some suspect of ill masked not thy show, then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.      no longer mourn for me when i am dead, than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell: nay if you read this line, remember not, the hand that writ it, for i love you so, that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, if thinking on me then should make you woe. o if (i say) you look upon this verse, when i (perhaps) compounded am with clay, do not so much as my poor name rehearse; but let your love even with my life decay. lest the wise world should look into your moan, and mock you with me after i am gone.    o lest the world should task you to recite, what merit lived in me that you should love after my death (dear love) forget me quite, for you in me can nothing worthy prove.   unless you would devise some virtuous lie, to do more for me than mine own desert, and hang more praise upon deceased i, than niggard truth would willingly impart: o lest your true love may seem false in this, that you for love speak well of me untrue, my name be buried where my body is, and live no more to shame nor me, nor you. for i am shamed by that which i bring forth, and so should you, to love things nothing worth.    that time of year thou mayst in me behold, when yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold, bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. in me thou seest the twilight of such day, as after sunset fadeth in the west, which by and by black night doth take away, death's second self that seals up all in rest.   in me thou seest the glowing of such fire, that on the ashes of his youth doth lie, as the death-bed, whereon it must expire, consumed with that which it was nourished by. this thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, to love that well, which thou must leave ere long.    but be contented when that fell arrest, without all bail shall carry me away, my life hath in this line some interest, which for memorial still with thee shall stay. when thou reviewest this, thou dost review, the very part was consecrate to thee, the earth can have but earth, which is his due, my spirit is thine the better part of me, so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, the prey of worms, my body being dead, the coward conquest of a wretch's knife, too base of thee to be remembered,   the worth of that, is that which it contains, and that is this, and this with thee remains.    so are you to my thoughts as food to life, or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground; and for the peace of you i hold such strife as 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found. now proud as an enjoyer, and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure, now counting best to be with you alone, then bettered that the world may see my pleasure, sometime all full with feasting on your sight, and by and by clean starved for a look, possessing or pursuing no delight save what is had, or must from you be took. thus do i pine and surfeit day by day, or gluttoning on all, or all away.      why is my verse so barren of new pride? so far from variation or quick change? why with the time do i not glance aside to new-found methods, and to compounds strange? why write i still all one, ever the same, and keep invention in a noted weed, that every word doth almost tell my name, showing their birth, and where they did proceed? o know sweet love i always write of you, and you and love are still my argument: so all my best is dressing old words new, spending again what is already spent: for as the sun is daily new and old, so is my love still telling what is told.    thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear, thy dial how thy precious minutes waste, these vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear, and of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.   the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show, of mouthed graves will give thee memory, thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know, time's thievish progress to eternity. look what thy memory cannot contain, commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find those children nursed, delivered from thy brain, to take a new acquaintance of thy mind. these offices, so oft as thou wilt look, shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.    so oft have i invoked thee for my muse, and found such fair assistance in my verse, as every alien pen hath got my use, and under thee their poesy disperse. thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing, and heavy ignorance aloft to fly, have added feathers to the learned's wing, and given grace a double majesty. yet be most proud of that which i compile, whose influence is thine, and born of thee, in others' works thou dost but mend the style, and arts with thy sweet graces graced be. but thou art all my art, and dost advance as high as learning, my rude ignorance.    whilst i alone did call upon thy aid, my verse alone had all thy gentle grace, but now my gracious numbers are decayed, and my sick muse doth give an other place. i grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen, yet what of thee thy poet doth invent, he robs thee of, and pays it thee again, he lends thee virtue, and he stole that word, from thy behaviour, beauty doth he give and found it in thy cheek: he can afford no praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.   then thank him not for that which he doth say, since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.    o how i faint when i of you do write, knowing a better spirit doth use your name, and in the praise thereof spends all his might, to make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame. but since your worth (wide as the ocean is) the humble as the proudest sail doth bear, my saucy bark (inferior far to his) on your broad main doth wilfully appear. your shallowest help will hold me up afloat, whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride, or (being wrecked) i am a worthless boat, he of tall building, and of goodly pride. then if he thrive and i be cast away, the worst was this, my love was my decay.      or i shall live your epitaph to make, or you survive when i in earth am rotten, from hence your memory death cannot take, although in me each part will be forgotten. your name from hence immortal life shall have, though i (once gone) to all the world must die, the earth can yield me but a common grave, when you entombed in men's eyes shall lie, your monument shall be my gentle verse, which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read, and tongues to be, your being shall rehearse, when all the breathers of this world are dead, you still shall live (such virtue hath my pen) where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.    i grant thou wert not married to my muse, and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject, blessing every book.   thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue, finding thy worth a limit past my praise, and therefore art enforced to seek anew, some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days. and do so love, yet when they have devised, what strained touches rhetoric can lend, thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized, in true plain words, by thy true-telling friend. and their gross painting might be better used, where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.    i never saw that you did painting need, and therefore to your fair no painting set, i found (or thought i found) you did exceed, that barren tender of a poet's debt: and therefore have i slept in your report, that you your self being extant well might show, how far a modern quill doth come too short, speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.   this silence for my sin you did impute, which shall be most my glory being dumb, for i impair not beauty being mute, when others would give life, and bring a tomb. there lives more life in one of your fair eyes, than both your poets can in praise devise.    who is it that says most, which can say more, than this rich praise, that you alone, are you? in whose confine immured is the store, which should example where your equal grew. lean penury within that pen doth dwell, that to his subject lends not some small glory, but he that writes of you, if he can tell, that you are you, so dignifies his story. let him but copy what in you is writ, not making worse what nature made so clear, and such a counterpart shall fame his wit, making his style admired every where.   you to your beauteous blessings add a curse, being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.    my tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still, while comments of your praise richly compiled, reserve their character with golden quill, and precious phrase by all the muses filed. i think good thoughts, whilst other write good words, and like unlettered clerk still cry amen, to every hymn that able spirit affords, in polished form of well refined pen. hearing you praised, i say 'tis so, 'tis true, and to the most of praise add something more, but that is in my thought, whose love to you (though words come hindmost) holds his rank before, then others, for the breath of words respect, me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.      was it the proud full sail of his great verse, bound for the prize of (all too precious) you, that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse, making their tomb the womb wherein they grew? was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write, above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead? no, neither he, nor his compeers by night giving him aid, my verse astonished. he nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence, as victors of my silence cannot boast, i was not sick of any fear from thence. but when your countenance filled up his line, then lacked i matter, that enfeebled mine.    farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing, and like enough thou know'st thy estimate, the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing: my bonds in thee are all determinate.   for how do i hold thee but by thy granting, and for that riches where is my deserving? the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, and so my patent back again is swerving. thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing, or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking, so thy great gift upon misprision growing, comes home again, on better judgement making. thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter, in sleep a king, but waking no such matter.    when thou shalt be disposed to set me light, and place my merit in the eye of scorn, upon thy side, against my self i'll fight, and prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn: with mine own weakness being best acquainted, upon thy part i can set down a story of faults concealed, wherein i am attainted: that thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:   and i by this will be a gainer too, for bending all my loving thoughts on thee, the injuries that to my self i do, doing thee vantage, double-vantage me. such is my love, to thee i so belong, that for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.    say that thou didst forsake me for some fault, and i will comment upon that offence, speak of my lameness, and i straight will halt: against thy reasons making no defence. thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill, to set a form upon desired change, as i'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will, i will acquaintance strangle and look strange: be absent from thy walks and in my tongue, thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell, lest i (too much profane) should do it wronk: and haply of our old acquaintance tell.   for thee, against my self i'll vow debate, for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.    then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now, now while the world is bent my deeds to cross, join with the spite of fortune, make me bow, and do not drop in for an after-loss: ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow, come in the rearward of a conquered woe, give not a windy night a rainy morrow, to linger out a purposed overthrow. if thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last, when other petty griefs have done their spite, but in the onset come, so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortune's might. and other strains of woe, which now seem woe, compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.      some glory in their birth, some in their skill, some in their wealth, some in their body's force, some in their garments though new-fangled ill: some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse. and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure, wherein it finds a joy above the rest, but these particulars are not my measure, all these i better in one general best. thy love is better than high birth to me, richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs, of more delight than hawks and horses be: and having thee, of all men's pride i boast. wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take, all this away, and me most wretchcd make.    but do thy worst to steal thy self away, for term of life thou art assured mine, and life no longer than thy love will stay, for it depends upon that love of thine.   then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs, when in the least of them my life hath end, i see, a better state to me belongs than that, which on thy humour doth depend. thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind, since that my life on thy revolt doth lie, o what a happy title do i find, happy to have thy love, happy to die! but what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot? thou mayst be false, and yet i know it not.    so shall i live, supposing thou art true, like a deceived husband, so love's face, may still seem love to me, though altered new: thy looks with me, thy heart in other place. for there can live no hatred in thine eye, therefore in that i cannot know thy change, in many's looks, the false heart's history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.   but heaven in thy creation did decree, that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell, whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be, thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell. how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow, if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.    they that have power to hurt, and will do none, that do not do the thing, they most do show, who moving others, are themselves as stone, unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow: they rightly do inherit heaven's graces, and husband nature's riches from expense, tibey are the lords and owners of their faces, others, but stewards of their excellence: the summer's flower is to the summer sweet, though to it self, it only live and die, but if that flower with base infection meet, the basest weed outbraves his dignity:   for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds, lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.    how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame, which like a canker in the fragrant rose, doth spot the beauty of thy budding name! o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose! that tongue that tells the story of thy days, (making lascivious comments on thy sport) cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise, naming thy name, blesses an ill report. o what a mansion have those vices got, which for their habitation chose out thee, where beauty's veil doth cover every blot, and all things turns to fair, that eyes can see! take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege, the hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.      some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness, some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport, both grace and faults are loved of more and less: thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort: as on the finger of a throned queen, the basest jewel will be well esteemed: so are those errors that in thee are seen, to truths translated, and for true things deemed. how many lambs might the stern wolf betray, if like a lamb he could his looks translate! how many gazers mightst thou lead away, if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state! but do not so, i love thee in such sort, as thou being mine, mine is thy good report.    how like a winter hath my absence been from thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! what freezings have i felt, what dark days seen! what old december's bareness everywhere!   and yet this time removed was summer's time, the teeming autumn big with rich increase, bearing the wanton burden of the prime, like widowed wombs after their lords' decease: yet this abundant issue seemed to me but hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit, for summer and his pleasures wait on thee, and thou away, the very birds are mute. or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer, that leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.    from you have i been absent in the spring, when proud-pied april (dressed in all his trim) hath put a spirit of youth in every thing: that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him. yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue, could make me any summer's story tell: or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:   nor did i wonder at the lily's white, nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose, they were but sweet, but figures of delight: drawn after you, you pattern of all those. yet seemed it winter still, and you away, as with your shadow i with these did play.    the forward violet thus did i chide, sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells, if not from my love's breath? the purple pride which on thy soft check for complexion dwells, in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed. the lily i condemned for thy hand, and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair, the roses fearfully on thorns did stand, one blushing shame, another white despair: a third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both, and to his robbery had annexed thy breath, but for his theft in pride of all his growth   a vengeful canker eat him up to death. more flowers i noted, yet i none could see, but sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.    where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long, to speak of that which gives thee all thy might? spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song, darkening thy power to lend base subjects light? return forgetful muse, and straight redeem, in gentle numbers time so idly spent, sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem, and gives thy pen both skill and argument. rise resty muse, my love's sweet face survey, if time have any wrinkle graven there, if any, be a satire to decay, and make time's spoils despised everywhere. give my love fame faster than time wastes life, so thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife.    o truant muse what shall be thy amends, for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed? both truth and beauty on my love depends: so dost thou too, and therein dignified: make answer muse, wilt thou not haply say, 'truth needs no colour with his colour fixed, beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay: but best is best, if never intermixed'? because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb? excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee, to make him much outlive a gilded tomb: and to be praised of ages yet to be. then do thy office muse, i teach thee how, to make him seem long hence, as he shows now.    my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming, i love not less, though less the show appear, that love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,   the owner's tongue doth publish every where. our love was new, and then but in the spring, when i was wont to greet it with my lays, as philomel in summer's front doth sing, and stops her pipe in growth of riper days: not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, but that wild music burthens every bough, and sweets grown common lose their dear delight. therefore like her, i sometime hold my tongue: because i would not dull you with my song.    alack what poverty my muse brings forth, that having such a scope to show her pride, the argument all bare is of more worth than when it hath my added praise beside. o blame me not if i no more can write! look in your glass and there appears a face, that over-goes my blunt invention quite,   dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace. were it not sinful then striving to mend, to mar the subject that before was well? for to no other pass my verses tend, than of your graces and your gifts to tell. and more, much more than in my verse can sit, your own glass shows you, when you look in it.    to me fair friend you never can be old, for as you were when first your eye i eyed, such seems your beauty still: three winters cold, have from the forests shook three summers' pride, three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned, in process of the seasons have i seen, three april perfumes in three hot junes burned, since first i saw you fresh which yet are green. ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand, steal from his figure, and no pace perceived, so your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand   hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived. for fear of which, hear this thou age unbred, ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.    let not my love be called idolatry, nor my beloved as an idol show, since all alike my songs and praises be to one, of one, still such, and ever so. kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind, still constant in a wondrous excellence, therefore my verse to constancy confined, one thing expressing, leaves out difference. fair, kind, and true, is all my argument, fair, kind, and true, varying to other words, and in this change is my invention spent, three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords. fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone. which three till now, never kept seat in one.    when in the chronicle of wasted time, i see descriptions of the fairest wights, and beauty making beautiful old rhyme, in praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights, then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, i see their antique pen would have expressed, even such a beauty as you master now. so all their praises are but prophecies of this our time, all you prefiguring, and for they looked but with divining eyes, they had not skill enough your worth to sing: for we which now behold these present days, have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.    not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul, of the wide world, dreaming on things to come, can yet the lease of my true love control,   supposed as forfeit to a confined doom. the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured, and the sad augurs mock their own presage, incertainties now crown themselves assured, and peace proclaims olives of endless age. now with the drops of this most balmy time, my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes, since spite of him i'll live in this poor rhyme, while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes. and thou in this shalt find thy monument, when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.    what's in the brain that ink may character, which hath not figured to thee my true spirit, what's new to speak, what now to register, that may express my love, or thy dear merit? nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine, i must each day say o'er the very same, counting no old thing old, thou mine, i thine,   even as when first i hallowed thy fair name. so that eternal love in love's fresh case, weighs not the dust and injury of age, nor gives to necessary wrinkles place, but makes antiquity for aye his page, finding the first conceit of love there bred, where time and outward form would show it dead.    o never say that i was false of heart, though absence seemed my flame to qualify, as easy might i from my self depart, as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie: that is my home of love, if i have ranged, like him that travels i return again, just to the time, not with the time exchanged, so that my self bring water for my stain, never believe though in my nature reigned, all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, that it could so preposterously be stained,   to leave for nothing all thy sum of good: for nothing this wide universe i call, save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.    alas 'tis true, i have gone here and there, and made my self a motley to the view, gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, made old offences of affections new. most true it is, that i have looked on truth askance and strangely: but by all above, these blenches gave my heart another youth, and worse essays proved thee my best of love. now all is done, have what shall have no end, mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof, to try an older friend, a god in love, to whom i am confined. then give me welcome, next my heaven the best, even to thy pure and most most loving breast.    o for my sake do you with fortune chide, the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, that did not better for my life provide, than public means which public manners breeds. thence comes it that my name receives a brand, and almost thence my nature is subdued to what it works in, like the dyer's hand: pity me then, and wish i were renewed, whilst like a willing patient i will drink, potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection, no bitterness that i will bitter think, nor double penance to correct correction. pity me then dear friend, and i assure ye, even that your pity is enough to cure me.    your love and pity doth th' impression fill, which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow, for what care i who calls me well or ill,   so you o'er-green my bad, my good allow? you are my all the world, and i must strive, to know my shames and praises from your tongue, none else to me, nor i to none alive, that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong. in so profound abysm i throw all care of others' voices, that my adder's sense, to critic and to flatterer stopped are: mark how with my neglect i do dispense. you are so strongly in my purpose bred, that all the world besides methinks are dead.    since i left you, mine eye is in my mind, and that which governs me to go about, doth part his function, and is partly blind, seems seeing, but effectually is out: for it no form delivers to the heart of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch, of his quick objects hath the mind no part,   nor his own vision holds what it doth catch: for if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight, the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature, the mountain, or the sea, the day, or night: the crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature. incapable of more, replete with you, my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.    or whether doth my mind being crowned with you drink up the monarch's plague this flattery? or whether shall i say mine eye saith true, and that your love taught it this alchemy? to make of monsters, and things indigest, such cherubins as your sweet self resemble, creating every bad a perfect best as fast as objects to his beams assemble: o 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing, and my great mind most kingly drinks it up, mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,   and to his palate doth prepare the cup. if it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin, that mine eye loves it and doth first begin.    those lines that i before have writ do lie, even those that said i could not love you dearer, yet then my judgment knew no reason why, my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer, but reckoning time, whose millioned accidents creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings, tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents, divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things: alas why fearing of time's tyranny, might i not then say 'now i love you best,' when i was certain o'er incertainty, crowning the present, doubting of the rest? love is a babe, then might i not say so to give full growth to that which still doth grow.    let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments, love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove. o no, it is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wand'ring bark, whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come, love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, but bears it out even to the edge of doom: if this be error and upon me proved, i never writ, nor no man ever loved.    accuse me thus, that i have scanted all, wherein i should your great deserts repay, forgot upon your dearest love to call,   whereto all bonds do tie me day by day, that i have frequent been with unknown minds, and given to time your own dear-purchased right, that i have hoisted sail to all the winds which should transport me farthest from your sight. book both my wilfulness and errors down, and on just proof surmise, accumulate, bring me within the level of your frown, but shoot not at me in your wakened hate: since my appeal says i did strive to prove the constancy and virtue of your love.    like as to make our appetite more keen with eager compounds we our palate urge, as to prevent our maladies unseen, we sicken to shun sickness when we purge. even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness, to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding; and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,   to be diseased ere that there was true needing. thus policy in love t' anticipate the ills that were not, grew to faults assured, and brought to medicine a healthful state which rank of goodness would by ill be cured. but thence i learn and find the lesson true, drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.    what potions have i drunk of siren tears distilled from limbecks foul as hell within, applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears, still losing when i saw my self to win! what wretched errors hath my heart committed, whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never! how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted in the distraction of this madding fever! o benefit of ill, now i find true that better is, by evil still made better. and ruined love when it is built anew   grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater. so i return rebuked to my content, and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent.    that you were once unkind befriends me now, and for that sorrow, which i then did feel, needs must i under my transgression bow, unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel. for if you were by my unkindness shaken as i by yours, y'have passed a hell of time, and i a tyrant have no leisure taken to weigh how once i suffered in your crime. o that our night of woe might have remembered my deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits, and soon to you, as you to me then tendered the humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits! but that your trespass now becomes a fee, mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.    'tis better to be vile than vile esteemed, when not to be, receives reproach of being, and the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed, not by our feeling, but by others' seeing. for why should others' false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood? or on my frailties why are frailer spies, which in their wills count bad what i think good? no, i am that i am, and they that level at my abuses, reckon up their own, i may be straight though they themselves be bevel; by their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown unless this general evil they maintain, all men are bad and in their badness reign.    thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain full charactered with lasting memory, which shall above that idle rank remain   beyond all date even to eternity. or at the least, so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist, till each to razed oblivion yield his part of thee, thy record never can be missed: that poor retention could not so much hold, nor need i tallies thy dear love to score, therefore to give them from me was i bold, to trust those tables that receive thee more: to keep an adjunct to remember thee were to import forgetfulness in me.    no! time, thou shalt not boast that i do change, thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel, nothing strange, they are but dressings of a former sight: our dates are brief, and therefore we admire, what thou dost foist upon us that is old, and rather make them born to our desire,   than think that we before have heard them told: thy registers and thee i both defy, not wond'ring at the present, nor the past, for thy records, and what we see doth lie, made more or less by thy continual haste: this i do vow and this shall ever be, i will be true despite thy scythe and thee.    if my dear love were but the child of state, it might for fortune's bastard be unfathered, as subject to time's love or to time's hate, weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered. no it was builded far from accident, it suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent, whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls: it fears not policy that heretic, which works on leases of short-numbered hours, but all alone stands hugely politic,   that it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers. to this i witness call the fools of time, which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.    were't aught to me i bore the canopy, with my extern the outward honouring, or laid great bases for eternity, which proves more short than waste or ruining? have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all, and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet; forgoing simple savour, pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent? no, let me be obsequious in thy heart, and take thou my oblation, poor but free, which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art, but mutual render, only me for thee. hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul when most impeached, stands least in thy control.    o thou my lovely boy who in thy power, dost hold time's fickle glass his fickle hour: who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st, thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st. if nature (sovereign mistress over wrack) as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back, she keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill may time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill. yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure, she may detain, but not still keep her treasure! her audit (though delayed) answered must be, and her quietus is to render thee.    in the old age black was not counted fair, or if it were it bore not beauty's name: but now is black beauty's successive heir, and beauty slandered with a bastard shame, for since each hand hath put on nature's power,   fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face, sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower, but is profaned, if not lives in disgrace. therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black, her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem, at such who not born fair no beauty lack, slandering creation with a false esteem, yet so they mourn becoming of their woe, that every tongue says beauty should look so.    how oft when thou, my music, music play'st, upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st the wiry concord that mine ear confounds, do i envy those jacks that nimble leap, to kiss the tender inward of thy hand, whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap, at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand. to be so tickled they would change their state   and situation with those dancing chips, o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait, making dead wood more blest than living lips, since saucy jacks so happy are in this, give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.    th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action, and till action, lust is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame, savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust, enjoyed no sooner but despised straight, past reason hunted, and no sooner had past reason hated as a swallowed bait, on purpose laid to make the taker mad. mad in pursuit and in possession so, had, having, and in quest, to have extreme, a bliss in proof and proved, a very woe, before a joy proposed behind a dream. all this the world well knows yet none knows well,   to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.    my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun, coral is far more red, than her lips red, if snow be white, why then her breasts are dun: if hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head: i have seen roses damasked, red and white, but no such roses see i in her cheeks, and in some perfumes is there more delight, than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. i love to hear her speak, yet well i know, that music hath a far more pleasing sound: i grant i never saw a goddess go, my mistress when she walks treads on the ground. and yet by heaven i think my love as rare, as any she belied with false compare.    thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,   as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel. yet in good faith some say that thee behold, thy face hath not the power to make love groan; to say they err, i dare not be so bold, although i swear it to my self alone. and to be sure that is not false i swear, a thousand groans but thinking on thy face, one on another's neck do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgment's place. in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds, and thence this slander as i think proceeds.    thine eyes i love, and they as pitying me, knowing thy heart torment me with disdain, have put on black, and loving mourners be, looking with pretty ruth upon my pain. and truly not the morning sun of heaven   better becomes the grey cheeks of the east, nor that full star that ushers in the even doth half that glory to the sober west as those two mourning eyes become thy face: o let it then as well beseem thy heart to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace, and suit thy pity like in every part. then will i swear beauty herself is black, and all they foul that thy complexion lack.    beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan for that deep wound it gives my friend and me; is't not enough to torture me alone, but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be? me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken, and my next self thou harder hast engrossed, of him, my self, and thee i am forsaken, a torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed: prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,   but then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail, whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard, thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol. and yet thou wilt, for i being pent in thee, perforce am thine and all that is in me.    so now i have confessed that he is thine, and i my self am mortgaged to thy will, my self i'll forfeit, so that other mine, thou wilt restore to be my comfort still: but thou wilt not, nor he will not be free, for thou art covetous, and he is kind, he learned but surety-like to write for me, under that bond that him as fist doth bind. the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take, thou usurer that put'st forth all to use, and sue a friend, came debtor for my sake, so him i lose through my unkind abuse. him have i lost, thou hast both him and me,   he pays the whole, and yet am i not free.    whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will, and 'will' to boot, and 'will' in over-plus, more than enough am i that vex thee still, to thy sweet will making addition thus. wilt thou whose will is large and spacious, not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine? shall will in others seem right gracious, and in my will no fair acceptance shine? the sea all water, yet receives rain still, and in abundance addeth to his store, so thou being rich in will add to thy will one will of mine to make thy large will more. let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill, think all but one, and me in that one 'will.'    if thy soul check thee that i come so near,   swear to thy blind soul that i was thy 'will', and will thy soul knows is admitted there, thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil. 'will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love, ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one, in things of great receipt with case we prove, among a number one is reckoned none. then in the number let me pass untold, though in thy store's account i one must be, for nothing hold me, so it please thee hold, that nothing me, a something sweet to thee. make but my name thy love, and love that still, and then thou lov'st me for my name is will.    thou blind fool love, what dost thou to mine eyes, that they behold and see not what they see? they know what beauty is, see where it lies, yet what the best is, take the worst to be. if eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,   be anchored in the bay where all men ride, why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks, whereto the judgment of my heart is tied? why should my heart think that a several plot, which my heart knows the wide world's common place? or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not to put fair truth upon so foul a face? in things right true my heart and eyes have erred, and to this false plague are they now transferred.    when my love swears that she is made of truth, i do believe her though i know she lies, that she might think me some untutored youth, unlearned in the world's false subtleties. thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, although she knows my days are past the best, simply i credit her false-speaking tongue, on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed: but wherefore says she not she is unjust?   and wherefore say not i that i am old? o love's best habit is in seeming trust, and age in love, loves not to have years told. therefore i lie with her, and she with me, and in our faults by lies we flattered be.    o call not me to justify the wrong, that thy unkindness lays upon my heart, wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue, use power with power, and slay me not by art, tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight, dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside, what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide? let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows, her pretty looks have been mine enemies, and therefore from my face she turns my foes, that they elsewhere might dart their injuries: yet do not so, but since i am near slain,   kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.    be wise as thou art cruel, do not press my tongue-tied patience with too much disdain: lest sorrow lend me words and words express, the manner of my pity-wanting pain. if i might teach thee wit better it were, though not to love, yet love to tell me so, as testy sick men when their deaths be near, no news but health from their physicians know. for if i should despair i should grow mad, and in my madness might speak ill of thee, now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad, mad slanderers by mad ears believed be. that i may not be so, nor thou belied, bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.    in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes,   for they in thee a thousand errors note, but 'tis my heart that loves what they despise, who in despite of view is pleased to dote. nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted, nor tender feeling to base touches prone, nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone: but my five wits, nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee, who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man, thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be: only my plague thus far i count my gain, that she that makes me sin, awards me pain.    love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate, hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving, o but with mine, compare thou thine own state, and thou shalt find it merits not reproving, or if it do, not from those lips of thine,   that have profaned their scarlet ornaments, and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine, robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents. be it lawful i love thee as thou lov'st those, whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee, root pity in thy heart that when it grows, thy pity may deserve to pitied be. if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide, by self-example mayst thou be denied.    lo as a careful huswife runs to catch, one of her feathered creatures broke away, sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch in pursuit of the thing she would have stay: whilst her neglected child holds her in chase, cries to catch her whose busy care is bent, to follow that which flies before her face: not prizing her poor infant's discontent; so run'st thou after that which flies from thee,   whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind, but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me: and play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind. so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will, if thou turn back and my loud crying still.    two loves i have of comfort and despair, which like two spirits do suggest me still, the better angel is a man right fair: the worser spirit a woman coloured ill. to win me soon to hell my female evil, tempteth my better angel from my side, and would corrupt my saint to be a devil: wooing his purity with her foul pride. and whether that my angel be turned fiend, suspect i may, yet not directly tell, but being both from me both to each friend, i guess one angel in another's hell. yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt,   till my bad angel fire my good one out.    those lips that love's own hand did make, breathed forth the sound that said 'i hate', to me that languished for her sake: but when she saw my woeful state, straight in her heart did mercy come, chiding that tongue that ever sweet, was used in giving gentle doom: and taught it thus anew to greet: 'i hate' she altered with an end, that followed it as gentle day, doth follow night who like a fiend from heaven to hell is flown away. 'i hate', from hate away she threw, and saved my life saying 'not you'.  poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,   my sinful earth these rebel powers array, why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth painting thy outward walls so costly gay? why so large cost having so short a lease, dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? shall worms inheritors of this excess eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end? then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss, and let that pine to aggravate thy store; buy terms divine in selling hours of dross; within be fed, without be rich no more, so shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men, and death once dead, there's no more dying then.  my love is as a fever longing still, for that which longer nurseth the disease, feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, th' uncertain sickly appetite to please: my reason the physician to my love,   angry that his prescriptions are not kept hath left me, and i desperate now approve, desire is death, which physic did except. past cure i am, now reason is past care, and frantic-mad with evermore unrest, my thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are, at random from the truth vainly expressed. for i have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright, who art as black as hell, as dark as night.  o me! what eyes hath love put in my head, which have no correspondence with true sight, or if they have, where is my judgment fled, that censures falsely what they see aright? if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote, what means the world to say it is not so? if it be not, then love doth well denote, love's eye is not so true as all men's: no, how can it? o how can love's eye be true,   that is so vexed with watching and with tears? no marvel then though i mistake my view, the sun it self sees not, till heaven clears. o cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind, lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.  canst thou o cruel, say i love thee not, when i against my self with thee partake? do i not think on thee when i forgot am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake? who hateth thee that i do call my friend, on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon, nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend revenge upon my self with present moan? what merit do i in my self respect, that is so proud thy service to despise, when all my best doth worship thy defect, commanded by the motion of thine eyes? but love hate on for now i know thy mind,   those that can see thou lov'st, and i am blind.  o from what power hast thou this powerful might, with insufficiency my heart to sway, to make me give the lie to my true sight, and swear that brightness doth not grace the day? whence hast thou this becoming of things ill, that in the very refuse of thy deeds, there is such strength and warrantise of skill, that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds? who taught thee how to make me love thee more, the more i hear and see just cause of hate? o though i love what others do abhor, with others thou shouldst not abhor my state. if thy unworthiness raised love in me, more worthy i to be beloved of thee.  love is too young to know what conscience is,   yet who knows not conscience is born of love? then gentle cheater urge not my amiss, lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove. for thou betraying me, i do betray my nobler part to my gross body's treason, my soul doth tell my body that he may, triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason, but rising at thy name doth point out thee, as his triumphant prize, proud of this pride, he is contented thy poor drudge to be, to stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side. no want of conscience hold it that i call, her love, for whose dear love i rise and fall.  in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn, but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing, in act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn, in vowing new hate after new love bearing: but why of two oaths' breach do i accuse thee,   when i break twenty? i am perjured most, for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee: and all my honest faith in thee is lost. for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness: oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy, and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness, or made them swear against the thing they see. for i have sworn thee fair: more perjured i, to swear against the truth so foul a be.  cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep, a maid of dian's this advantage found, and his love-kindling fire did quickly steep in a cold valley-fountain of that ground: which borrowed from this holy fire of love, a dateless lively heat still to endure, and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove, against strange maladies a sovereign cure: but at my mistress' eye love's brand new-fired,   the boy for trial needs would touch my breast, i sick withal the help of bath desired, and thither hied a sad distempered guest. but found no cure, the bath for my help lies, where cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.  the little love-god lying once asleep, laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand, whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep, came tripping by, but in her maiden hand, the fairest votary took up that fire, which many legions of true hearts had warmed, and so the general of hot desire, was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed. this brand she quenched in a cool well by, which from love's fire took heat perpetual, growing a bath and healthful remedy, for men discased, but i my mistress' thrall, came there for cure and this by that i prove,   love's fire heats water, water cools not love.                   the end\""

they do but sweetly chide thee  who confounds in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear    mark how one string sweet husband to another  strikes each in each by mutual ordering  resembling sire  and child  and happy mother  who all in one  one pleasing note do sing  whose speechless song being many  seeming one  sings this to thee   thou single wilt prove none    is it for fear to wet a widow s eye  that thou consum st thy self in single life  ah  if thou issueless shalt hap to die  the world will wail thee like a makeless wife  the world will be thy widow and still weep  that thou no form of thee hast left behind  when every private widow well may keep  by children s eyes  her husband s shape in mind  look what an unthrift in the world doth spend shifts but his place  for still the world enjoys it  but beauty s waste hath in the world an end  and kept unused the user so destroys it    no love toward others in that bosom sits that on himself such murd rous shame commits   for shame deny that thou bear st love to any who for thy self art so unprovident  grant if thou wilt  thou art beloved of many  but that thou none lov st is most evident  for thou art so possessed with murd rous hate  that  gainst thy self thou stick st not to conspire  seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire  o change thy thought  that i may change my mind  shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love  be as thy presence is gracious and kind  or to thy self at least kind hearted prove  make thee another self for love of me  that beauty still may live in thine or thee     as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow st  in one of thine  from that which thou departest  and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow st  thou mayst call thine  when thou from youth convertest  herein lives wisdom  beauty  and increase  without this folly  age  and cold decay  if all were minded so  the times should cease  and threescore year would make the world away  let those whom nature hath not made for store  harsh  featureless  and rude  barrenly perish  look whom she best endowed  she gave thee more  which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish  she carved thee for her seal  and meant thereby  thou shouldst print more  not let that copy die   when i do count the clock that tells the time  and see the brave day sunk in hideous night  when i behold the violet past prime  and sable curls all silvered o er with white    when lofty trees i see barren of leaves  which erst from heat did canopy the herd and summer s green all girded up in sheaves borne on the bier with white and bristly beard  then of thy beauty do i question make that thou among the wastes of time must go  since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake  and die as fast as they see others grow  and nothing  gainst time s scythe can make defence save breed to brave him  when he takes thee hence   o that you were your self  but love you are no longer yours  than you your self here live  against this coming end you should prepare  and your sweet semblance to some other give  so should that beauty which you hold in lease find no determination  then you were your self again after your self s decease  when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear    who lets so fair a house fall to decay  which husbandry in honour might uphold  against the stormy gusts of winter s day and barren rage of death s eternal cold  o none but unthrifts  dear my love you know  you had a father  let your son say so   not from the stars do i my judgement pluck  and yet methinks i have astronomy  but not to tell of good  or evil luck  of plagues  of dearths  or seasons  quality  nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell  pointing to each his thunder  rain and wind  or say with princes if it shall go well by oft predict that i in heaven find  but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive  and constant stars in them i read such art as truth and beauty shall together thrive if from thy self  to store thou wouldst convert    or else of thee this i prognosticate  thy end is truth s and beauty s doom and date   when i consider every thing that grows holds in perfection but a little moment  that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment  when i perceive that men as plants increase  cheered and checked even by the self same sky  vaunt in their youthful sap  at height decrease  and wear their brave state out of memory  then the conceit of this inconstant stay  sets you most rich in youth before my sight  where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night  and all in war with time for love of you  as he takes from you  i engraft you new     but wherefore do not you a mightier way make war upon this bloody tyrant time  and fortify your self in your decay with means more blessed than my barren rhyme  now stand you on the top of happy hours  and many maiden gardens yet unset  with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers  much liker than your painted counterfeit  so should the lines of life that life repair which this  time s pencil  or my pupil pen neither in inward worth nor outward fair can make you live your self in eyes of men  to give away your self  keeps your self still  and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill   who will believe my verse in time to come if it were filled with your most high deserts  though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb which hides your life  and shows not half your parts    if i could write the beauty of your eyes  and in fresh numbers number all your graces  the age to come would say this poet lies  such heavenly touches ne er touched earthly faces  so should my papers  yellowed with their age  be scorned  like old men of less truth than tongue  and your true rights be termed a poet s rage  and stretched metre of an antique song  but were some child of yours alive that time  you should live twice in it  and in my rhyme   shall i compare thee to a summer s day  thou art more lovely and more temperate  rough winds do shake the darling buds of may  and summer s lease hath all too short a date  sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines  and often is his gold complexion dimmed  and every fair from fair sometime declines  by chance  or nature s changing course untrimmed    but thy eternal summer shall not fade  nor lose possession of that fair thou ow st  nor shall death brag thou wand rest in his shade  when in eternal lines to time thou grow st  so long as men can breathe or eyes can see  so long lives this  and this gives life to thee   devouring time blunt thou the lion s paws  and make the earth devour her own sweet brood  pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger s jaws  and burn the long lived phoenix  in her blood  make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet st  and do whate er thou wilt swift footed time to the wide world and all her fading sweets  but i forbid thee one most heinous crime  o carve not with thy hours my love s fair brow  nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen  him in thy course untainted do allow  for beauty s pattern to succeeding men    yet do thy worst old time  despite thy wrong  my love shall in my verse ever live young   a woman s face with nature s own hand painted  hast thou the master mistress of my passion  a woman s gentle heart but not acquainted with shifting change as is false women s fashion  an eye more bright than theirs  less false in rolling  gilding the object whereupon it gazeth  a man in hue all hues in his controlling  which steals men s eyes and women s souls amazeth  and for a woman wert thou first created  till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting  and by addition me of thee defeated  by adding one thing to my purpose nothing  but since she pricked thee out for women s pleasure  mine be thy love and thy love s use their treasure     so is it not with me as with that muse  stirred by a painted beauty to his verse  who heaven it self for ornament doth use  and every fair with his fair doth rehearse  making a couplement of proud compare with sun and moon  with earth and sea s rich gems  with april s first born flowers and all things rare  that heaven s air in this huge rondure hems  o let me true in love but truly write  and then believe me  my love is as fair  as any mother s child  though not so bright as those gold candles fixed in heaven s air  let them say more that like of hearsay well  i will not praise that purpose not to sell   my glass shall not persuade me i am old  so long as youth and thou are of one date  but when in thee time s furrows i behold  then look i death my days should expiate    for all that beauty that doth cover thee  is but the seemly raiment of my heart  which in thy breast doth live  as thine in me  how can i then be elder than thou art  o therefore love be of thyself so wary  as i not for my self  but for thee will  bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary as tender nurse her babe from faring ill  presume not on thy heart when mine is slain  thou gav st me thine not to give back again   as an unperfect actor on the stage  who with his fear is put beside his part  or some fierce thing replete with too much rage  whose strength s abundance weakens his own heart  so i for fear of trust  forget to say  the perfect ceremony of love s rite  and in mine own love s strength seem to decay  o ercharged with burthen of mine own love s might    o let my looks be then the eloquence  and dumb presagers of my speaking breast  who plead for love  and look for recompense  more than that tongue that more hath more expressed  o learn to read what silent love hath writ  to hear with eyes belongs to love s fine wit   mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled  thy beauty s form in table of my heart  my body is the frame wherein  tis held  and perspective it is best painter s art  for through the painter must you see his skill  to find where your true image pictured lies  which in my bosom s shop is hanging still  that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes  now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done  mine eyes have drawn thy shape  and thine for me are windows to my breast  where through the sun delights to peep  to gaze therein on thee    yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art  they draw but what they see  know not the heart   let those who are in favour with their stars  of public honour and proud titles boast  whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars unlooked for joy in that i honour most  great princes  favourites their fair leaves spread  but as the marigold at the sun s eye  and in themselves their pride lies buried  for at a frown they in their glory die  the painful warrior famoused for fight  after a thousand victories once foiled  is from the book of honour razed quite  and all the rest forgot for which he toiled  then happy i that love and am beloved where i may not remove nor be removed     lord of my love  to whom in vassalage thy merit hath my duty strongly knit  to thee i send this written embassage to witness duty  not to show my wit  duty so great  which wit so poor as mine may make seem bare  in wanting words to show it  but that i hope some good conceit of thine in thy soul s thought  all naked  will bestow it  till whatsoever star that guides my moving  points on me graciously with fair aspect  and puts apparel on my tattered loving  to show me worthy of thy sweet respect  then may i dare to boast how i do love thee  till then  not show my head where thou mayst prove me   weary with toil  i haste me to my bed  the dear respose for limbs with travel tired  but then begins a journey in my head to work my mind  when body s work s expired    for then my thoughts  from far where i abide  intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee  and keep my drooping eyelids open wide  looking on darkness which the blind do see  save that my soul s imaginary sight presents thy shadow to my sightless view  which like a jewel  hung in ghastly night  makes black night beauteous  and her old face new  lo thus by day my limbs  by night my mind  for thee  and for my self  no quiet find   how can i then return in happy plight that am debarred the benefit of rest  when day s oppression is not eased by night  but day by night and night by day oppressed  and each  though enemies to either s reign  do in consent shake hands to torture me  the one by toil  the other to complain how far i toil  still farther off from thee    i tell the day to please him thou art bright  and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven  so flatter i the swart complexioned night  when sparkling stars twire not thou gild st the even  but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer  and night doth nightly make grief s length seem stronger  when in disgrace with fortune and men s eyes  i all alone beweep my outcast state  and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries  and look upon my self and curse my fate  wishing me like to one more rich in hope  featured like him  like him with friends possessed  desiring this man s art  and that man s scope  with what i most enjoy contented least  yet in these thoughts my self almost despising  haply i think on thee  and then my state   like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth  sings hymns at heaven s gate    for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings  that then i scorn to change my state with kings   when to the sessions of sweet silent thought  i summon up remembrance of things past  i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought  and with old woes new wail my dear time s waste  then can i drown an eye  unused to flow  for precious friends hid in death s dateless night  and weep afresh love s long since cancelled woe  and moan th  expense of many a vanished sight  then can i grieve at grievances foregone  and heavily from woe to woe tell o er the sad account of fore bemoaned moan  which i new pay as if not paid before  but if the while i think on thee  dear friend  all losses are restored  and sorrows end     thy bosom is endeared with all hearts  which i by lacking have supposed dead  and there reigns love and all love s loving parts  and all those friends which i thought buried  how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stol n from mine eye  as interest of the dead  which now appear  but things removed that hidden in thee lie  thou art the grave where buried love doth live  hung with the trophies of my lovers gone  who all their parts of me to thee did give  that due of many  now is thine alone  their images i loved  i view in thee  and thou  all they  hast all the all of me   if thou survive my well contented day  when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more re survey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover    compare them with the bett ring of the time  and though they be outstripped by every pen  reserve them for my love  not for their rhyme  exceeded by the height of happier men  o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought   had my friend s muse grown with this growing age  a dearer birth than this his love had brought to march in ranks of better equipage  but since he died and poets better prove  theirs for their style i ll read  his for his love    full many a glorious morning have i seen  flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye  kissing with golden face the meadows green  gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy  anon permit the basest clouds to ride  with ugly rack on his celestial face  and from the forlorn world his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace    even so my sun one early morn did shine  with all triumphant splendour on my brow  but out alack  he was but one hour mine  the region cloud hath masked him from me now  yet him for this  my love no whit disdaineth  suns of the world may stain  when heaven s sun staineth   why didst thou promise such a beauteous day  and make me travel forth without my cloak  to let base clouds o ertake me in my way  hiding thy brav ry in their rotten smoke   tis not enough that through the cloud thou break  to dry the rain on my storm beaten face  for no man well of such a salve can speak  that heals the wound  and cures not the disgrace  nor can thy shame give physic to my grief  though thou repent  yet i have still the loss  th  offender s sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offence s cross    ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds  and they are rich  and ransom all ill deeds     no more be grieved at that which thou hast done  roses have thorns  and silver fountains mud  clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun  and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud  all men make faults  and even i in this  authorizing thy trespass with compare  my self corrupting salving thy amiss  excusing thy sins more than thy sins are  for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense  thy adverse party is thy advocate  and  gainst my self a lawful plea commence  such civil war is in my love and hate  that i an accessary needs must be  to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me     let me confess that we two must be twain  although our undivided loves are one  so shall those blots that do with me remain  without thy help  by me be borne alone  in our two loves there is but one respect  though in our lives a separable spite  which though it alter not love s sole effect  yet doth it steal sweet hours from love s delight  i may not evermore acknowledge thee  lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame  nor thou with public kindness honour me  unless thou take that honour from thy name  but do not so  i love thee in such sort  as thou being mine  mine is thy good report   as a decrepit father takes delight  to see his active child do deeds of youth  so i  made lame by fortune s dearest spite take all my comfort of thy worth and truth    for whether beauty  birth  or wealth  or wit  or any of these all  or all  or more entitled in thy parts  do crowned sit  i make my love engrafted to this store  so then i am not lame  poor  nor despised  whilst that this shadow doth such substance give  that i in thy abundance am sufficed  and by a part of all thy glory live  look what is best  that best i wish in thee  this wish i have  then ten times happy me   how can my muse want subject to invent while thou dost breathe that pour st into my verse  thine own sweet argument  too excellent  for every vulgar paper to rehearse  o give thy self the thanks if aught in me  worthy perusal stand against thy sight  for who s so dumb that cannot write to thee  when thou thy self dost give invention light    be thou the tenth muse  ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate  and he that calls on thee  let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date  if my slight muse do please these curious days  the pain be mine  but thine shall be the praise   o how thy worth with manners may i sing  when thou art all the better part of me  what can mine own praise to mine own self bring  and what is t but mine own when i praise thee  even for this  let us divided live  and our dear love lose name of single one  that by this separation i may give  that due to thee which thou deserv st alone  o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove  were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave  to entertain the time with thoughts of love  which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive    and that thou teachest how to make one twain  by praising him here who doth hence remain   take all my loves  my love  yea take them all  what hast thou then more than thou hadst before  no love  my love  that thou mayst true love call  all mine was thine  before thou hadst this more  then if for my love  thou my love receivest  i cannot blame thee  for my love thou usest  but yet be blamed  if thou thy self deceivest by wilful taste of what thy self refusest  i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief although thou steal thee all my poverty  and yet love knows it is a greater grief to bear greater wrong  than hate s known injury  lascivious grace  in whom all ill well shows  kill me with spites yet we must not be foes     those pretty wrongs that liberty commits  when i am sometime absent from thy heart  thy beauty  and thy years full well befits  for still temptation follows where thou art  gentle thou art  and therefore to be won  beauteous thou art  therefore to be assailed  and when a woman woos  what woman s son  will sourly leave her till he have prevailed  ay me  but yet thou mightst my seat forbear  and chide thy beauty  and thy straying youth  who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth  hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee  thine by thy beauty being false to me   that thou hast her it is not all my grief  and yet it may be said i loved her dearly  that she hath thee is of my wailing chief  a loss in love that touches me more nearly    loving offenders thus i will excuse ye  thou dost love her  because thou know st i love her  and for my sake even so doth she abuse me  suff ring my friend for my sake to approve her  if i lose thee  my loss is my love s gain  and losing her  my friend hath found that loss  both find each other  and i lose both twain  and both for my sake lay on me this cross  but here s the joy  my friend and i are one  sweet flattery  then she loves but me alone   when most i wink then do mine eyes best see  for all the day they view things unrespected  but when i sleep  in dreams they look on thee  and darkly bright  are bright in dark directed  then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright how would thy shadow s form  form happy show  to the clear day with thy much clearer light  when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so    how would  i say  mine eyes be blessed made  by looking on thee in the living day  when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade  through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay  all days are nights to see till i see thee  and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me   if the dull substance of my flesh were thought  injurious distance should not stop my way  for then despite of space i would be brought  from limits far remote  where thou dost stay  no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removed from thee  for nimble thought can jump both sea and land  as soon as think the place where he would be  but ah  thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone  but that so much of earth and water wrought  i must attend  time s leisure with my moan    receiving nought by elements so slow  but heavy tears  badges of either s woe   the other two  slight air  and purging fire  are both with thee  wherever i abide  the first my thought  the other my desire  these present absent with swift motion slide  for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee  my life being made of four  with two alone  sinks down to death  oppressed with melancholy  until life s composition be recured  by those swift messengers returned from thee  who even but now come back again assured  of thy fair health  recounting it to me  this told  i joy  but then no longer glad  i send them back again and straight grow sad     mine eye and heart are at a mortal war  how to divide the conquest of thy sight  mine eye  my heart thy picture s sight would bar  my heart  mine eye the freedom of that right  my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie   a closet never pierced with crystal eyes  but the defendant doth that plea deny  and says in him thy fair appearance lies  to side this title is impanelled a quest of thoughts  all tenants to the heart  and by their verdict is determined the clear eye s moiety  and the dear heart s part  as thus  mine eye s due is thy outward part  and my heart s right  thy inward love of heart   betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took  and each doth good turns now unto the other  when that mine eye is famished for a look  or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother    with my love s picture then my eye doth feast  and to the painted banquet bids my heart  another time mine eye is my heart s guest  and in his thoughts of love doth share a part  so either by thy picture or my love  thy self away  art present still with me  for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move  and i am still with them  and they with thee  or if they sleep  thy picture in my sight awakes my heart  to heart s and eye s delight   how careful was i when i took my way  each trifle under truest bars to thrust  that to my use it might unused stay from hands of falsehood  in sure wards of trust  but thou  to whom my jewels trifles are  most worthy comfort  now my greatest grief  thou best of dearest  and mine only care  art left the prey of every vulgar thief    thee have i not locked up in any chest  save where thou art not  though i feel thou art  within the gentle closure of my breast  from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part  and even thence thou wilt be stol n i fear  for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear   against that time  if ever that time come  when i shall see thee frown on my defects  when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum  called to that audit by advised respects  against that time when thou shalt strangely pass  and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye  when love converted from the thing it was shall reasons find of settled gravity  against that time do i ensconce me here within the knowledge of mine own desert  and this my hand  against my self uprear  to guard the lawful reasons on thy part    to leave poor me  thou hast the strength of laws  since why to love  i can allege no cause   how heavy do i journey on the way  when what i seek  my weary travel s end  doth teach that case and that repose to say  thus far the miles are measured from thy friend   the beast that bears me  tired with my woe  plods dully on  to bear that weight in me  as if by some instinct the wretch did know his rider loved not speed being made from thee  the bloody spur cannot provoke him on  that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide  which heavily he answers with a groan  more sharp to me than spurring to his side  for that same groan doth put this in my mind  my grief lies onward and my joy behind     thus can my love excuse the slow offence  of my dull bearer  when from thee i speed  from where thou art  why should i haste me thence  till i return of posting is no need  o what excuse will my poor beast then find  when swift extremity can seem but slow  then should i spur though mounted on the wind  in winged speed no motion shall i know  then can no horse with my desire keep pace  therefore desire  of perfect st love being made  shall neigh  no dull flesh  in his fiery race  but love  for love  thus shall excuse my jade  since from thee going  he went wilful slow  towards thee i ll run  and give him leave to go   so am i as the rich whose blessed key  can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure  the which he will not every hour survey  for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure    therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare  since seldom coming in that long year set  like stones of worth they thinly placed are  or captain jewels in the carcanet  so is the time that keeps you as my chest or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide  to make some special instant special blest  by new unfolding his imprisoned pride  blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope  being had to triumph  being lacked to hope   what is your substance  whereof are you made  that millions of strange shadows on you tend  since every one  hath every one  one shade  and you but one  can every shadow lend  describe adonis and the counterfeit  is poorly imitated after you  on helen s cheek all art of beauty set  and you in grecian tires are painted new    speak of the spring  and foison of the year  the one doth shadow of your beauty show  the other as your bounty doth appear  and you in every blessed shape we know  in all external grace you have some part  but you like none  none you for constant heart   o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem  by that sweet ornament which truth doth give  the rose looks fair  but fairer we it deem for that sweet odour  which doth in it live  the canker blooms have full as deep a dye  as the perfumed tincture of the roses  hang on such thorns  and play as wantonly  when summer s breath their masked buds discloses  but for their virtue only is their show  they live unwooed  and unrespected fade  die to themselves  sweet roses do not so  of their sweet deaths  are sweetest odours made    and so of you  beauteous and lovely youth  when that shall vade  by verse distills your truth   not marble  nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme  but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone  besmeared with sluttish time  when wasteful war shall statues overturn  and broils root out the work of masonry  nor mars his sword  nor war s quick fire shall burn  the living record of your memory   gainst death  and all oblivious enmity shall you pace forth  your praise shall still find room  even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom  so till the judgment that your self arise  you live in this  and dwell in lovers  eyes     sweet love renew thy force  be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite  which but to day by feeding is allayed  to morrow sharpened in his former might  so love be thou  although to day thou fill thy hungry eyes  even till they wink with fulness  to morrow see again  and do not kill the spirit of love  with a perpetual dulness  let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore  where two contracted new  come daily to the banks  that when they see  return of love  more blest may be the view  or call it winter  which being full of care  makes summer s welcome  thrice more wished  more rare   being your slave what should i do but tend  upon the hours  and times of your desire  i have no precious time at all to spend  nor services to do till you require    nor dare i chide the world without end hour  whilst i  my sovereign  watch the clock for you  nor think the bitterness of absence sour  when you have bid your servant once adieu  nor dare i question with my jealous thought  where you may be  or your affairs suppose  but like a sad slave stay and think of nought save where you are  how happy you make those  so true a fool is love  that in your will   though you do any thing  he thinks no ill   that god forbid  that made me first your slave  i should in thought control your times of pleasure  or at your hand th  account of hours to crave  being your vassal bound to stay your leisure  o let me suffer  being at your beck  th  imprisoned absence of your liberty  and patience tame to sufferance bide each check  without accusing you of injury    be where you list  your charter is so strong  that you your self may privilage your time to what you will  to you it doth belong  your self to pardon of self doing crime  i am to wait  though waiting so be hell  not blame your pleasure be it ill or well   if there be nothing new  but that which is  hath been before  how are our brains beguiled  which labouring for invention bear amis the second burthen of a former child  o that record could with a backward look  even of five hundred courses of the sun  show me your image in some antique book  since mind at first in character was done  that i might see what the old world could say  to this composed wonder of your frame  whether we are mended  or whether better they  or whether revolution be the same    o sure i am the wits of former days  to subjects worse have given admiring praise   like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore  so do our minutes hasten to their end  each changing place with that which goes before  in sequent toil all forwards do contend  nativity once in the main of light  crawls to maturity  wherewith being crowned  crooked eclipses  gainst his glory fight  and time that gave  doth now his gift confound  time doth transfix the flourish set on youth  and delves the parallels in beauty s brow  feeds on the rarities of nature s truth  and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow  and yet to times in hope  my verse shall stand praising thy worth  despite his cruel hand     is it thy will  thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night  dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken  while shadows like to thee do mock my sight  is it thy spirit that thou send st from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry  to find out shames and idle hours in me  the scope and tenure of thy jealousy  o no  thy love though much  is not so great  it is my love that keeps mine eye awake  mine own true love that doth my rest defeat  to play the watchman ever for thy sake  for thee watch i  whilst thou dost wake elsewhere  from me far off  with others all too near   sin of self love possesseth all mine eye  and all my soul  and all my every part  and for this sin there is no remedy  it is so grounded inward in my heart    methinks no face so gracious is as mine  no shape so true  no truth of such account  and for my self mine own worth do define  as i all other in all worths surmount  but when my glass shows me my self indeed beated and chopt with tanned antiquity  mine own self love quite contrary i read  self  so self loving were iniquity   tis thee  my self  that for my self i praise  painting my age with beauty of thy days   against my love shall be as i am now with time s injurious hand crushed and o erworn  when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow with lines and wrinkles  when his youthful morn hath travelled on to age s steepy night  and all those beauties whereof now he s king are vanishing  or vanished out of sight  stealing away the treasure of his spring    for such a time do i now fortify against confounding age s cruel knife  that he shall never cut from memory my sweet love s beauty  though my lover s life  his beauty shall in these black lines be seen  and they shall live  and he in them still green   when i have seen by time s fell hand defaced the rich proud cost of outworn buried age  when sometime lofty towers i see down rased  and brass eternal slave to mortal rage  when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore  and the firm soil win of the watery main  increasing store with loss  and loss with store  when i have seen such interchange of state  or state it self confounded  to decay  ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away    this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have  that which it fears to lose   since brass  nor stone  nor earth  nor boundless sea  but sad mortality o ersways their power  how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea  whose action is no stronger than a flower  o how shall summer s honey breath hold out  against the wrackful siege of batt ring days  when rocks impregnable are not so stout  nor gates of steel so strong but time decays  o fearful meditation  where alack  shall time s best jewel from time s chest lie hid  or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back  or who his spoil of beauty can forbid  o none  unless this miracle have might  that in black ink my love may still shine bright     tired with all these for restful death i cry  as to behold desert a beggar born  and needy nothing trimmed in jollity  and purest faith unhappily forsworn  and gilded honour shamefully misplaced  and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted  and right perfection wrongfully disgraced  and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tongue tied by authority  and folly  doctor like  controlling skill  and simple truth miscalled simplicity  and captive good attending captain ill  tired with all these  from these would i be gone  save that to die  i leave my love alone   ah wherefore with infection should he live  and with his presence grace impiety  that sin by him advantage should achieve  and lace it self with his society    why should false painting imitate his cheek  and steal dead seeming of his living hue  why should poor beauty indirectly seek  roses of shadow  since his rose is true  why should he live  now nature bankrupt is  beggared of blood to blush through lively veins  for she hath no exchequer now but his  and proud of many  lives upon his gains  o him she stores  to show what wealth she had  in days long since  before these last so bad   thus is his cheek the map of days outworn  when beauty lived and died as flowers do now  before these bastard signs of fair were born  or durst inhabit on a living brow  before the golden tresses of the dead  the right of sepulchres  were shorn away  to live a second life on second head  ere beauty s dead fleece made another gay    in him those holy antique hours are seen  without all ornament  it self and true  making no summer of another s green  robbing no old to dress his beauty new  and him as for a map doth nature store  to show false art what beauty was of yore   those parts of thee that the world s eye doth view  want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend  all tongues  the voice of souls  give thee that due  uttering bare truth  even so as foes commend  thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned  but those same tongues that give thee so thine own  in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown  they look into the beauty of thy mind  and that in guess they measure by thy deeds  then churls their thoughts  although their eyes were kind  to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds    but why thy odour matcheth not thy show  the soil is this  that thou dost common grow     that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect  for slander s mark was ever yet the fair  the ornament of beauty is suspect  a crow that flies in heaven s sweetest air  so thou be good  slander doth but approve  thy worth the greater being wooed of time  for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love  and thou present st a pure unstained prime  thou hast passed by the ambush of young days  either not assailed  or victor being charged  yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise  to tie up envy  evermore enlarged  if some suspect of ill masked not thy show  then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe       no longer mourn for me when i am dead  than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell  nay if you read this line  remember not  the hand that writ it  for i love you so  that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot  if thinking on me then should make you woe  o if  i say  you look upon this verse  when i  perhaps  compounded am with clay  do not so much as my poor name rehearse  but let your love even with my life decay  lest the wise world should look into your moan  and mock you with me after i am gone     o lest the world should task you to recite  what merit lived in me that you should love after my death  dear love  forget me quite  for you in me can nothing worthy prove    unless you would devise some virtuous lie  to do more for me than mine own desert  and hang more praise upon deceased i  than niggard truth would willingly impart  o lest your true love may seem false in this  that you for love speak well of me untrue  my name be buried where my body is  and live no more to shame nor me  nor you  for i am shamed by that which i bring forth  and so should you  to love things nothing worth     that time of year thou mayst in me behold  when yellow leaves  or none  or few do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold  bare ruined choirs  where late the sweet birds sang  in me thou seest the twilight of such day  as after sunset fadeth in the west  which by and by black night doth take away  death s second self that seals up all in rest    in me thou seest the glowing of such fire  that on the ashes of his youth doth lie  as the death bed  whereon it must expire  consumed with that which it was nourished by  this thou perceiv st  which makes thy love more strong  to love that well  which thou must leave ere long     but be contented when that fell arrest  without all bail shall carry me away  my life hath in this line some interest  which for memorial still with thee shall stay  when thou reviewest this  thou dost review  the very part was consecrate to thee  the earth can have but earth  which is his due  my spirit is thine the better part of me  so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life  the prey of worms  my body being dead  the coward conquest of a wretch s knife  too base of thee to be remembered    the worth of that  is that which it contains  and that is this  and this with thee remains     so are you to my thoughts as food to life  or as sweet seasoned showers are to the ground  and for the peace of you i hold such strife as  twixt a miser and his wealth is found  now proud as an enjoyer  and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure  now counting best to be with you alone  then bettered that the world may see my pleasure  sometime all full with feasting on your sight  and by and by clean starved for a look  possessing or pursuing no delight save what is had  or must from you be took  thus do i pine and surfeit day by day  or gluttoning on all  or all away       why is my verse so barren of new pride  so far from variation or quick change  why with the time do i not glance aside to new found methods  and to compounds strange  why write i still all one  ever the same  and keep invention in a noted weed  that every word doth almost tell my name  showing their birth  and where they did proceed  o know sweet love i always write of you  and you and love are still my argument  so all my best is dressing old words new  spending again what is already spent  for as the sun is daily new and old  so is my love still telling what is told     thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear  thy dial how thy precious minutes waste  these vacant leaves thy mind s imprint will bear  and of this book  this learning mayst thou taste    the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show  of mouthed graves will give thee memory  thou by thy dial s shady stealth mayst know  time s thievish progress to eternity  look what thy memory cannot contain  commit to these waste blanks  and thou shalt find those children nursed  delivered from thy brain  to take a new acquaintance of thy mind  these offices  so oft as thou wilt look  shall profit thee  and much enrich thy book     so oft have i invoked thee for my muse  and found such fair assistance in my verse  as every alien pen hath got my use  and under thee their poesy disperse  thine eyes  that taught the dumb on high to sing  and heavy ignorance aloft to fly  have added feathers to the learned s wing  and given grace a double majesty  yet be most proud of that which i compile  whose influence is thine  and born of thee  in others  works thou dost but mend the style  and arts with thy sweet graces graced be  but thou art all my art  and dost advance as high as learning  my rude ignorance     whilst i alone did call upon thy aid  my verse alone had all thy gentle grace  but now my gracious numbers are decayed  and my sick muse doth give an other place  i grant  sweet love  thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen  yet what of thee thy poet doth invent  he robs thee of  and pays it thee again  he lends thee virtue  and he stole that word  from thy behaviour  beauty doth he give and found it in thy cheek  he can afford no praise to thee  but what in thee doth live    then thank him not for that which he doth say  since what he owes thee  thou thy self dost pay     o how i faint when i of you do write  knowing a better spirit doth use your name  and in the praise thereof spends all his might  to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame  but since your worth  wide as the ocean is  the humble as the proudest sail doth bear  my saucy bark  inferior far to his  on your broad main doth wilfully appear  your shallowest help will hold me up afloat  whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride  or  being wrecked  i am a worthless boat  he of tall building  and of goodly pride  then if he thrive and i be cast away  the worst was this  my love was my decay       or i shall live your epitaph to make  or you survive when i in earth am rotten  from hence your memory death cannot take  although in me each part will be forgotten  your name from hence immortal life shall have  though i  once gone  to all the world must die  the earth can yield me but a common grave  when you entombed in men s eyes shall lie  your monument shall be my gentle verse  which eyes not yet created shall o er read  and tongues to be  your being shall rehearse  when all the breathers of this world are dead  you still shall live  such virtue hath my pen  where breath most breathes  even in the mouths of men     i grant thou wert not married to my muse  and therefore mayst without attaint o erlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject  blessing every book    thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue  finding thy worth a limit past my praise  and therefore art enforced to seek anew  some fresher stamp of the time bettering days  and do so love  yet when they have devised  what strained touches rhetoric can lend  thou truly fair  wert truly sympathized  in true plain words  by thy true telling friend  and their gross painting might be better used  where cheeks need blood  in thee it is abused     i never saw that you did painting need  and therefore to your fair no painting set  i found  or thought i found  you did exceed  that barren tender of a poet s debt  and therefore have i slept in your report  that you your self being extant well might show  how far a modern quill doth come too short  speaking of worth  what worth in you doth grow    this silence for my sin you did impute  which shall be most my glory being dumb  for i impair not beauty being mute  when others would give life  and bring a tomb  there lives more life in one of your fair eyes  than both your poets can in praise devise     who is it that says most  which can say more  than this rich praise  that you alone  are you  in whose confine immured is the store  which should example where your equal grew  lean penury within that pen doth dwell  that to his subject lends not some small glory  but he that writes of you  if he can tell  that you are you  so dignifies his story  let him but copy what in you is writ  not making worse what nature made so clear  and such a counterpart shall fame his wit  making his style admired every where    you to your beauteous blessings add a curse  being fond on praise  which makes your praises worse     my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still  while comments of your praise richly compiled  reserve their character with golden quill  and precious phrase by all the muses filed  i think good thoughts  whilst other write good words  and like unlettered clerk still cry amen  to every hymn that able spirit affords  in polished form of well refined pen  hearing you praised  i say  tis so   tis true  and to the most of praise add something more  but that is in my thought  whose love to you  though words come hindmost  holds his rank before  then others  for the breath of words respect  me for my dumb thoughts  speaking in effect       was it the proud full sail of his great verse  bound for the prize of  all too precious  you  that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse  making their tomb the womb wherein they grew  was it his spirit  by spirits taught to write  above a mortal pitch  that struck me dead  no  neither he  nor his compeers by night giving him aid  my verse astonished  he nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence  as victors of my silence cannot boast  i was not sick of any fear from thence  but when your countenance filled up his line  then lacked i matter  that enfeebled mine     farewell  thou art too dear for my possessing  and like enough thou know st thy estimate  the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing  my bonds in thee are all determinate    for how do i hold thee but by thy granting  and for that riches where is my deserving  the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting  and so my patent back again is swerving  thy self thou gav st  thy own worth then not knowing  or me to whom thou gav st it  else mistaking  so thy great gift upon misprision growing  comes home again  on better judgement making  thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter  in sleep a king  but waking no such matter     when thou shalt be disposed to set me light  and place my merit in the eye of scorn  upon thy side  against my self i ll fight  and prove thee virtuous  though thou art forsworn  with mine own weakness being best acquainted  upon thy part i can set down a story of faults concealed  wherein i am attainted  that thou in losing me  shalt win much glory    and i by this will be a gainer too  for bending all my loving thoughts on thee  the injuries that to my self i do  doing thee vantage  double vantage me  such is my love  to thee i so belong  that for thy right  my self will bear all wrong     say that thou didst forsake me for some fault  and i will comment upon that offence  speak of my lameness  and i straight will halt  against thy reasons making no defence  thou canst not  love  disgrace me half so ill  to set a form upon desired change  as i ll my self disgrace  knowing thy will  i will acquaintance strangle and look strange  be absent from thy walks and in my tongue  thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell  lest i  too much profane  should do it wronk  and haply of our old acquaintance tell    for thee  against my self i ll vow debate  for i must ne er love him whom thou dost hate     then hate me when thou wilt  if ever  now  now while the world is bent my deeds to cross  join with the spite of fortune  make me bow  and do not drop in for an after loss  ah do not  when my heart hath  scaped this sorrow  come in the rearward of a conquered woe  give not a windy night a rainy morrow  to linger out a purposed overthrow  if thou wilt leave me  do not leave me last  when other petty griefs have done their spite  but in the onset come  so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortune s might  and other strains of woe  which now seem woe  compared with loss of thee  will not seem so       some glory in their birth  some in their skill  some in their wealth  some in their body s force  some in their garments though new fangled ill  some in their hawks and hounds  some in their horse  and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure  wherein it finds a joy above the rest  but these particulars are not my measure  all these i better in one general best  thy love is better than high birth to me  richer than wealth  prouder than garments  costs  of more delight than hawks and horses be  and having thee  of all men s pride i boast  wretched in this alone  that thou mayst take  all this away  and me most wretchcd make     but do thy worst to steal thy self away  for term of life thou art assured mine  and life no longer than thy love will stay  for it depends upon that love of thine    then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs  when in the least of them my life hath end  i see  a better state to me belongs than that  which on thy humour doth depend  thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind  since that my life on thy revolt doth lie  o what a happy title do i find  happy to have thy love  happy to die  but what s so blessed fair that fears no blot  thou mayst be false  and yet i know it not     so shall i live  supposing thou art true  like a deceived husband  so love s face  may still seem love to me  though altered new  thy looks with me  thy heart in other place  for there can live no hatred in thine eye  therefore in that i cannot know thy change  in many s looks  the false heart s history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange    but heaven in thy creation did decree  that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell  whate er thy thoughts  or thy heart s workings be  thy looks should nothing thence  but sweetness tell  how like eve s apple doth thy beauty grow  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show     they that have power to hurt  and will do none  that do not do the thing  they most do show  who moving others  are themselves as stone  unmoved  cold  and to temptation slow  they rightly do inherit heaven s graces  and husband nature s riches from expense  tibey are the lords and owners of their faces  others  but stewards of their excellence  the summer s flower is to the summer sweet  though to it self  it only live and die  but if that flower with base infection meet  the basest weed outbraves his dignity    for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds  lilies that fester  smell far worse than weeds     how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame  which like a canker in the fragrant rose  doth spot the beauty of thy budding name  o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose  that tongue that tells the story of thy days   making lascivious comments on thy sport  cannot dispraise  but in a kind of praise  naming thy name  blesses an ill report  o what a mansion have those vices got  which for their habitation chose out thee  where beauty s veil doth cover every blot  and all things turns to fair  that eyes can see  take heed  dear heart  of this large privilege  the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge       some say thy fault is youth  some wantonness  some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport  both grace and faults are loved of more and less  thou mak st faults graces  that to thee resort  as on the finger of a throned queen  the basest jewel will be well esteemed  so are those errors that in thee are seen  to truths translated  and for true things deemed  how many lambs might the stern wolf betray  if like a lamb he could his looks translate  how many gazers mightst thou lead away  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state  but do not so  i love thee in such sort  as thou being mine  mine is thy good report     how like a winter hath my absence been from thee  the pleasure of the fleeting year  what freezings have i felt  what dark days seen  what old december s bareness everywhere    and yet this time removed was summer s time  the teeming autumn big with rich increase  bearing the wanton burden of the prime  like widowed wombs after their lords  decease  yet this abundant issue seemed to me but hope of orphans  and unfathered fruit  for summer and his pleasures wait on thee  and thou away  the very birds are mute  or if they sing   tis with so dull a cheer  that leaves look pale  dreading the winter s near     from you have i been absent in the spring  when proud pied april  dressed in all his trim  hath put a spirit of youth in every thing  that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him  yet nor the lays of birds  nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue  could make me any summer s story tell  or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew    nor did i wonder at the lily s white  nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose  they were but sweet  but figures of delight  drawn after you  you pattern of all those  yet seemed it winter still  and you away  as with your shadow i with these did play     the forward violet thus did i chide  sweet thief  whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells  if not from my love s breath  the purple pride which on thy soft check for complexion dwells  in my love s veins thou hast too grossly dyed  the lily i condemned for thy hand  and buds of marjoram had stol n thy hair  the roses fearfully on thorns did stand  one blushing shame  another white despair  a third nor red  nor white  had stol n of both  and to his robbery had annexed thy breath  but for his theft in pride of all his growth   a vengeful canker eat him up to death  more flowers i noted  yet i none could see  but sweet  or colour it had stol n from thee     where art thou muse that thou forget st so long  to speak of that which gives thee all thy might  spend st thou thy fury on some worthless song  darkening thy power to lend base subjects light  return forgetful muse  and straight redeem  in gentle numbers time so idly spent  sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem  and gives thy pen both skill and argument  rise resty muse  my love s sweet face survey  if time have any wrinkle graven there  if any  be a satire to decay  and make time s spoils despised everywhere  give my love fame faster than time wastes life  so thou prevent st his scythe  and crooked knife     o truant muse what shall be thy amends  for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed  both truth and beauty on my love depends  so dost thou too  and therein dignified  make answer muse  wilt thou not haply say   truth needs no colour with his colour fixed  beauty no pencil  beauty s truth to lay  but best is best  if never intermixed   because he needs no praise  wilt thou be dumb  excuse not silence so  for t lies in thee  to make him much outlive a gilded tomb  and to be praised of ages yet to be  then do thy office muse  i teach thee how  to make him seem long hence  as he shows now     my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming  i love not less  though less the show appear  that love is merchandized  whose rich esteeming    the owner s tongue doth publish every where  our love was new  and then but in the spring  when i was wont to greet it with my lays  as philomel in summer s front doth sing  and stops her pipe in growth of riper days  not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night  but that wild music burthens every bough  and sweets grown common lose their dear delight  therefore like her  i sometime hold my tongue  because i would not dull you with my song     alack what poverty my muse brings forth  that having such a scope to show her pride  the argument all bare is of more worth than when it hath my added praise beside  o blame me not if i no more can write  look in your glass and there appears a face  that over goes my blunt invention quite    dulling my lines  and doing me disgrace  were it not sinful then striving to mend  to mar the subject that before was well  for to no other pass my verses tend  than of your graces and your gifts to tell  and more  much more than in my verse can sit  your own glass shows you  when you look in it     to me fair friend you never can be old  for as you were when first your eye i eyed  such seems your beauty still  three winters cold  have from the forests shook three summers  pride  three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned  in process of the seasons have i seen  three april perfumes in three hot junes burned  since first i saw you fresh which yet are green  ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand  steal from his figure  and no pace perceived  so your sweet hue  which methinks still doth stand   hath motion  and mine eye may be deceived  for fear of which  hear this thou age unbred  ere you were born was beauty s summer dead     let not my love be called idolatry  nor my beloved as an idol show  since all alike my songs and praises be to one  of one  still such  and ever so  kind is my love to day  to morrow kind  still constant in a wondrous excellence  therefore my verse to constancy confined  one thing expressing  leaves out difference  fair  kind  and true  is all my argument  fair  kind  and true  varying to other words  and in this change is my invention spent  three themes in one  which wondrous scope affords  fair  kind  and true  have often lived alone  which three till now  never kept seat in one     when in the chronicle of wasted time  i see descriptions of the fairest wights  and beauty making beautiful old rhyme  in praise of ladies dead  and lovely knights  then in the blazon of sweet beauty s best  of hand  of foot  of lip  of eye  of brow  i see their antique pen would have expressed  even such a beauty as you master now  so all their praises are but prophecies of this our time  all you prefiguring  and for they looked but with divining eyes  they had not skill enough your worth to sing  for we which now behold these present days  have eyes to wonder  but lack tongues to praise     not mine own fears  nor the prophetic soul  of the wide world  dreaming on things to come  can yet the lease of my true love control    supposed as forfeit to a confined doom  the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured  and the sad augurs mock their own presage  incertainties now crown themselves assured  and peace proclaims olives of endless age  now with the drops of this most balmy time  my love looks fresh  and death to me subscribes  since spite of him i ll live in this poor rhyme  while he insults o er dull and speechless tribes  and thou in this shalt find thy monument  when tyrants  crests and tombs of brass are spent     what s in the brain that ink may character  which hath not figured to thee my true spirit  what s new to speak  what now to register  that may express my love  or thy dear merit  nothing sweet boy  but yet like prayers divine  i must each day say o er the very same  counting no old thing old  thou mine  i thine    even as when first i hallowed thy fair name  so that eternal love in love s fresh case  weighs not the dust and injury of age  nor gives to necessary wrinkles place  but makes antiquity for aye his page  finding the first conceit of love there bred  where time and outward form would show it dead     o never say that i was false of heart  though absence seemed my flame to qualify  as easy might i from my self depart  as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie  that is my home of love  if i have ranged  like him that travels i return again  just to the time  not with the time exchanged  so that my self bring water for my stain  never believe though in my nature reigned  all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood  that it could so preposterously be stained    to leave for nothing all thy sum of good  for nothing this wide universe i call  save thou my rose  in it thou art my all     alas  tis true  i have gone here and there  and made my self a motley to the view  gored mine own thoughts  sold cheap what is most dear  made old offences of affections new  most true it is  that i have looked on truth askance and strangely  but by all above  these blenches gave my heart another youth  and worse essays proved thee my best of love  now all is done  have what shall have no end  mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof  to try an older friend  a god in love  to whom i am confined  then give me welcome  next my heaven the best  even to thy pure and most most loving breast     o for my sake do you with fortune chide  the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds  that did not better for my life provide  than public means which public manners breeds  thence comes it that my name receives a brand  and almost thence my nature is subdued to what it works in  like the dyer s hand  pity me then  and wish i were renewed  whilst like a willing patient i will drink  potions of eisel  gainst my strong infection  no bitterness that i will bitter think  nor double penance to correct correction  pity me then dear friend  and i assure ye  even that your pity is enough to cure me     your love and pity doth th  impression fill  which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow  for what care i who calls me well or ill    so you o er green my bad  my good allow  you are my all the world  and i must strive  to know my shames and praises from your tongue  none else to me  nor i to none alive  that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong  in so profound abysm i throw all care of others  voices  that my adder s sense  to critic and to flatterer stopped are  mark how with my neglect i do dispense  you are so strongly in my purpose bred  that all the world besides methinks are dead     since i left you  mine eye is in my mind  and that which governs me to go about  doth part his function  and is partly blind  seems seeing  but effectually is out  for it no form delivers to the heart of bird  of flower  or shape which it doth latch  of his quick objects hath the mind no part    nor his own vision holds what it doth catch  for if it see the rud st or gentlest sight  the most sweet favour or deformed st creature  the mountain  or the sea  the day  or night  the crow  or dove  it shapes them to your feature  incapable of more  replete with you  my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue     or whether doth my mind being crowned with you drink up the monarch s plague this flattery  or whether shall i say mine eye saith true  and that your love taught it this alchemy  to make of monsters  and things indigest  such cherubins as your sweet self resemble  creating every bad a perfect best as fast as objects to his beams assemble  o  tis the first   tis flattery in my seeing  and my great mind most kingly drinks it up  mine eye well knows what with his gust is  greeing    and to his palate doth prepare the cup  if it be poisoned   tis the lesser sin  that mine eye loves it and doth first begin     those lines that i before have writ do lie  even those that said i could not love you dearer  yet then my judgment knew no reason why  my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer  but reckoning time  whose millioned accidents creep in  twixt vows  and change decrees of kings  tan sacred beauty  blunt the sharp st intents  divert strong minds to the course of alt ring things  alas why fearing of time s tyranny  might i not then say  now i love you best   when i was certain o er incertainty  crowning the present  doubting of the rest  love is a babe  then might i not say so to give full growth to that which still doth grow     let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments  love is not love which alters when it alteration finds  or bends with the remover to remove  o no  it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken  it is the star to every wand ring bark  whose worth s unknown  although his height be taken  love s not time s fool  though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle s compass come  love alters not with his brief hours and weeks  but bears it out even to the edge of doom  if this be error and upon me proved  i never writ  nor no man ever loved     accuse me thus  that i have scanted all  wherein i should your great deserts repay  forgot upon your dearest love to call    whereto all bonds do tie me day by day  that i have frequent been with unknown minds  and given to time your own dear purchased right  that i have hoisted sail to all the winds which should transport me farthest from your sight  book both my wilfulness and errors down  and on just proof surmise  accumulate  bring me within the level of your frown  but shoot not at me in your wakened hate  since my appeal says i did strive to prove the constancy and virtue of your love     like as to make our appetite more keen with eager compounds we our palate urge  as to prevent our maladies unseen  we sicken to shun sickness when we purge  even so being full of your ne er cloying sweetness  to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding  and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness    to be diseased ere that there was true needing  thus policy in love t  anticipate the ills that were not  grew to faults assured  and brought to medicine a healthful state which rank of goodness would by ill be cured  but thence i learn and find the lesson true  drugs poison him that so feil sick of you     what potions have i drunk of siren tears distilled from limbecks foul as hell within  applying fears to hopes  and hopes to fears  still losing when i saw my self to win  what wretched errors hath my heart committed  whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never  how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted in the distraction of this madding fever  o benefit of ill  now i find true that better is  by evil still made better  and ruined love when it is built anew   grows fairer than at first  more strong  far greater  so i return rebuked to my content  and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent     that you were once unkind befriends me now  and for that sorrow  which i then did feel  needs must i under my transgression bow  unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel  for if you were by my unkindness shaken as i by yours  y have passed a hell of time  and i a tyrant have no leisure taken to weigh how once i suffered in your crime  o that our night of woe might have remembered my deepest sense  how hard true sorrow hits  and soon to you  as you to me then tendered the humble salve  which wounded bosoms fits  but that your trespass now becomes a fee  mine ransoms yours  and yours must ransom me      tis better to be vile than vile esteemed  when not to be  receives reproach of being  and the just pleasure lost  which is so deemed  not by our feeling  but by others  seeing  for why should others  false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood  or on my frailties why are frailer spies  which in their wills count bad what i think good  no  i am that i am  and they that level at my abuses  reckon up their own  i may be straight though they themselves be bevel  by their rank thoughts  my deeds must not be shown unless this general evil they maintain  all men are bad and in their badness reign     thy gift  thy tables  are within my brain full charactered with lasting memory  which shall above that idle rank remain   beyond all date even to eternity  or at the least  so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist  till each to razed oblivion yield his part of thee  thy record never can be missed  that poor retention could not so much hold  nor need i tallies thy dear love to score  therefore to give them from me was i bold  to trust those tables that receive thee more  to keep an adjunct to remember thee were to import forgetfulness in me     no  time  thou shalt not boast that i do change  thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel  nothing strange  they are but dressings of a former sight  our dates are brief  and therefore we admire  what thou dost foist upon us that is old  and rather make them born to our desire    than think that we before have heard them told  thy registers and thee i both defy  not wond ring at the present  nor the past  for thy records  and what we see doth lie  made more or less by thy continual haste  this i do vow and this shall ever be  i will be true despite thy scythe and thee     if my dear love were but the child of state  it might for fortune s bastard be unfathered  as subject to time s love or to time s hate  weeds among weeds  or flowers with flowers gathered  no it was builded far from accident  it suffers not in smiling pomp  nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent  whereto th  inviting time our fashion calls  it fears not policy that heretic  which works on leases of short numbered hours  but all alone stands hugely politic    that it nor grows with heat  nor drowns with showers  to this i witness call the fools of time  which die for goodness  who have lived for crime     were t aught to me i bore the canopy  with my extern the outward honouring  or laid great bases for eternity  which proves more short than waste or ruining  have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all  and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet  forgoing simple savour  pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent  no  let me be obsequious in thy heart  and take thou my oblation  poor but free  which is not mixed with seconds  knows no art  but mutual render  only me for thee  hence  thou suborned informer  a true soul when most impeached  stands least in thy control     o thou my lovely boy who in thy power  dost hold time s fickle glass his fickle hour  who hast by waning grown  and therein show st  thy lovers withering  as thy sweet self grow st  if nature  sovereign mistress over wrack  as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back  she keeps thee to this purpose  that her skill may time disgrace  and wretched minutes kill  yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure  she may detain  but not still keep her treasure  her audit  though delayed  answered must be  and her quietus is to render thee     in the old age black was not counted fair  or if it were it bore not beauty s name  but now is black beauty s successive heir  and beauty slandered with a bastard shame  for since each hand hath put on nature s power    fairing the foul with art s false borrowed face  sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower  but is profaned  if not lives in disgrace  therefore my mistress  eyes are raven black  her eyes so suited  and they mourners seem  at such who not born fair no beauty lack  slandering creation with a false esteem  yet so they mourn becoming of their woe  that every tongue says beauty should look so     how oft when thou  my music  music play st  upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway st the wiry concord that mine ear confounds  do i envy those jacks that nimble leap  to kiss the tender inward of thy hand  whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap  at the wood s boldness by thee blushing stand  to be so tickled they would change their state   and situation with those dancing chips  o er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait  making dead wood more blest than living lips  since saucy jacks so happy are in this  give them thy fingers  me thy lips to kiss     th  expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action  and till action  lust is perjured  murd rous  bloody full of blame  savage  extreme  rude  cruel  not to trust  enjoyed no sooner but despised straight  past reason hunted  and no sooner had past reason hated as a swallowed bait  on purpose laid to make the taker mad  mad in pursuit and in possession so  had  having  and in quest  to have extreme  a bliss in proof and proved  a very woe  before a joy proposed behind a dream  all this the world well knows yet none knows well    to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell     my mistress  eyes are nothing like the sun  coral is far more red  than her lips red  if snow be white  why then her breasts are dun  if hairs be wires  black wires grow on her head  i have seen roses damasked  red and white  but no such roses see i in her cheeks  and in some perfumes is there more delight  than in the breath that from my mistress reeks  i love to hear her speak  yet well i know  that music hath a far more pleasing sound  i grant i never saw a goddess go  my mistress when she walks treads on the ground  and yet by heaven i think my love as rare  as any she belied with false compare     thou art as tyrannous  so as thou art    as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel  for well thou know st to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel  yet in good faith some say that thee behold  thy face hath not the power to make love groan  to say they err  i dare not be so bold  although i swear it to my self alone  and to be sure that is not false i swear  a thousand groans but thinking on thy face  one on another s neck do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgment s place  in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds  and thence this slander as i think proceeds     thine eyes i love  and they as pitying me  knowing thy heart torment me with disdain  have put on black  and loving mourners be  looking with pretty ruth upon my pain  and truly not the morning sun of heaven   better becomes the grey cheeks of the east  nor that full star that ushers in the even doth half that glory to the sober west as those two mourning eyes become thy face  o let it then as well beseem thy heart to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace  and suit thy pity like in every part  then will i swear beauty herself is black  and all they foul that thy complexion lack     beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan for that deep wound it gives my friend and me  is t not enough to torture me alone  but slave to slavery my sweet st friend must be  me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken  and my next self thou harder hast engrossed  of him  my self  and thee i am forsaken  a torment thrice three fold thus to be crossed  prison my heart in thy steel bosom s ward    but then my friend s heart let my poor heart bail  whoe er keeps me  let my heart be his guard  thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol  and yet thou wilt  for i being pent in thee  perforce am thine and all that is in me     so now i have confessed that he is thine  and i my self am mortgaged to thy will  my self i ll forfeit  so that other mine  thou wilt restore to be my comfort still  but thou wilt not  nor he will not be free  for thou art covetous  and he is kind  he learned but surety like to write for me  under that bond that him as fist doth bind  the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take  thou usurer that put st forth all to use  and sue a friend  came debtor for my sake  so him i lose through my unkind abuse  him have i lost  thou hast both him and me    he pays the whole  and yet am i not free     whoever hath her wish  thou hast thy will  and  will  to boot  and  will  in over plus  more than enough am i that vex thee still  to thy sweet will making addition thus  wilt thou whose will is large and spacious  not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine  shall will in others seem right gracious  and in my will no fair acceptance shine  the sea all water  yet receives rain still  and in abundance addeth to his store  so thou being rich in will add to thy will one will of mine to make thy large will more  let no unkind  no fair beseechers kill  think all but one  and me in that one  will      if thy soul check thee that i come so near    swear to thy blind soul that i was thy  will   and will thy soul knows is admitted there  thus far for love  my love suit sweet fulfil   will   will fulfil the treasure of thy love  ay  fill it full with wills  and my will one  in things of great receipt with case we prove  among a number one is reckoned none  then in the number let me pass untold  though in thy store s account i one must be  for nothing hold me  so it please thee hold  that nothing me  a something sweet to thee  make but my name thy love  and love that still  and then thou lov st me for my name is will     thou blind fool love  what dost thou to mine eyes  that they behold and see not what they see  they know what beauty is  see where it lies  yet what the best is  take the worst to be  if eyes corrupt by over partial looks    be anchored in the bay where all men ride  why of eyes  falsehood hast thou forged hooks  whereto the judgment of my heart is tied  why should my heart think that a several plot  which my heart knows the wide world s common place  or mine eyes seeing this  say this is not to put fair truth upon so foul a face  in things right true my heart and eyes have erred  and to this false plague are they now transferred     when my love swears that she is made of truth  i do believe her though i know she lies  that she might think me some untutored youth  unlearned in the world s false subtleties  thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young  although she knows my days are past the best  simply i credit her false speaking tongue  on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed  but wherefore says she not she is unjust    and wherefore say not i that i am old  o love s best habit is in seeming trust  and age in love  loves not to have years told  therefore i lie with her  and she with me  and in our faults by lies we flattered be     o call not me to justify the wrong  that thy unkindness lays upon my heart  wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue  use power with power  and slay me not by art  tell me thou lov st elsewhere  but in my sight  dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside  what need st thou wound with cunning when thy might is more than my o erpressed defence can bide  let me excuse thee  ah my love well knows  her pretty looks have been mine enemies  and therefore from my face she turns my foes  that they elsewhere might dart their injuries  yet do not so  but since i am near slain    kill me outright with looks  and rid my pain     be wise as thou art cruel  do not press my tongue tied patience with too much disdain  lest sorrow lend me words and words express  the manner of my pity wanting pain  if i might teach thee wit better it were  though not to love  yet love to tell me so  as testy sick men when their deaths be near  no news but health from their physicians know  for if i should despair i should grow mad  and in my madness might speak ill of thee  now this ill wresting world is grown so bad  mad slanderers by mad ears believed be  that i may not be so  nor thou belied  bear thine eyes straight  though thy proud heart go wide     in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes    for they in thee a thousand errors note  but  tis my heart that loves what they despise  who in despite of view is pleased to dote  nor are mine cars with thy tongue s tune delighted  nor tender feeling to base touches prone  nor taste  nor smell  desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone  but my five wits  nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee  who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man  thy proud heart s slave and vassal wretch to be  only my plague thus far i count my gain  that she that makes me sin  awards me pain     love is my sin  and thy dear virtue hate  hate of my sin  grounded on sinful loving  o but with mine  compare thou thine own state  and thou shalt find it merits not reproving  or if it do  not from those lips of thine    that have profaned their scarlet ornaments  and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine  robbed others  beds  revenues of their rents  be it lawful i love thee as thou lov st those  whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee  root pity in thy heart that when it grows  thy pity may deserve to pitied be  if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide  by self example mayst thou be denied     lo as a careful huswife runs to catch  one of her feathered creatures broke away  sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch in pursuit of the thing she would have stay  whilst her neglected child holds her in chase  cries to catch her whose busy care is bent  to follow that which flies before her face  not prizing her poor infant s discontent  so run st thou after that which flies from thee    whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind  but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me  and play the mother s part  kiss me  be kind  so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will  if thou turn back and my loud crying still     two loves i have of comfort and despair  which like two spirits do suggest me still  the better angel is a man right fair  the worser spirit a woman coloured ill  to win me soon to hell my female evil  tempteth my better angel from my side  and would corrupt my saint to be a devil  wooing his purity with her foul pride  and whether that my angel be turned fiend  suspect i may  yet not directly tell  but being both from me both to each friend  i guess one angel in another s hell  yet this shall i ne er know but live in doubt    till my bad angel fire my good one out     those lips that love s own hand did make  breathed forth the sound that said  i hate   to me that languished for her sake  but when she saw my woeful state  straight in her heart did mercy come  chiding that tongue that ever sweet  was used in giving gentle doom  and taught it thus anew to greet   i hate  she altered with an end  that followed it as gentle day  doth follow night who like a fiend from heaven to hell is flown away   i hate   from hate away she threw  and saved my life saying  not you    poor soul the centre of my sinful earth    my sinful earth these rebel powers array  why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth painting thy outward walls so costly gay  why so large cost having so short a lease  dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend  shall worms inheritors of this excess eat up thy charge  is this thy body s end  then soul live thou upon thy servant s loss  and let that pine to aggravate thy store  buy terms divine in selling hours of dross  within be fed  without be rich no more  so shall thou feed on death  that feeds on men  and death once dead  there s no more dying then   my love is as a fever longing still  for that which longer nurseth the disease  feeding on that which doth preserve the ill  th  uncertain sickly appetite to please  my reason the physician to my love    angry that his prescriptions are not kept hath left me  and i desperate now approve  desire is death  which physic did except  past cure i am  now reason is past care  and frantic mad with evermore unrest  my thoughts and my discourse as mad men s are  at random from the truth vainly expressed  for i have sworn thee fair  and thought thee bright  who art as black as hell  as dark as night   o me  what eyes hath love put in my head  which have no correspondence with true sight  or if they have  where is my judgment fled  that censures falsely what they see aright  if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote  what means the world to say it is not so  if it be not  then love doth well denote  love s eye is not so true as all men s  no  how can it  o how can love s eye be true    that is so vexed with watching and with tears  no marvel then though i mistake my view  the sun it self sees not  till heaven clears  o cunning love  with tears thou keep st me blind  lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find   canst thou o cruel  say i love thee not  when i against my self with thee partake  do i not think on thee when i forgot am of my self  all tyrant  for thy sake  who hateth thee that i do call my friend  on whom frown st thou that i do fawn upon  nay if thou lour st on me do i not spend revenge upon my self with present moan  what merit do i in my self respect  that is so proud thy service to despise  when all my best doth worship thy defect  commanded by the motion of thine eyes  but love hate on for now i know thy mind    those that can see thou lov st  and i am blind   o from what power hast thou this powerful might  with insufficiency my heart to sway  to make me give the lie to my true sight  and swear that brightness doth not grace the day  whence hast thou this becoming of things ill  that in the very refuse of thy deeds  there is such strength and warrantise of skill  that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds  who taught thee how to make me love thee more  the more i hear and see just cause of hate  o though i love what others do abhor  with others thou shouldst not abhor my state  if thy unworthiness raised love in me  more worthy i to be beloved of thee   love is too young to know what conscience is    yet who knows not conscience is born of love  then gentle cheater urge not my amiss  lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove  for thou betraying me  i do betray my nobler part to my gross body s treason  my soul doth tell my body that he may  triumph in love  flesh stays no farther reason  but rising at thy name doth point out thee  as his triumphant prize  proud of this pride  he is contented thy poor drudge to be  to stand in thy affairs  fall by thy side  no want of conscience hold it that i call  her love  for whose dear love i rise and fall   in loving thee thou know st i am forsworn  but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing  in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn  in vowing new hate after new love bearing  but why of two oaths  breach do i accuse thee    when i break twenty  i am perjured most  for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee  and all my honest faith in thee is lost  for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness  oaths of thy love  thy truth  thy constancy  and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness  or made them swear against the thing they see  for i have sworn thee fair  more perjured i  to swear against the truth so foul a be   cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep  a maid of dian s this advantage found  and his love kindling fire did quickly steep in a cold valley fountain of that ground  which borrowed from this holy fire of love  a dateless lively heat still to endure  and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove  against strange maladies a sovereign cure  but at my mistress  eye love s brand new fired    the boy for trial needs would touch my breast  i sick withal the help of bath desired  and thither hied a sad distempered guest  but found no cure  the bath for my help lies  where cupid got new fire  my mistress  eyes   the little love god lying once asleep  laid by his side his heart inflaming brand  whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep  came tripping by  but in her maiden hand  the fairest votary took up that fire  which many legions of true hearts had warmed  and so the general of hot desire  was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed  this brand she quenched in a cool well by  which from love s fire took heat perpetual  growing a bath and healthful remedy  for men discased  but i my mistress  thrall  came there for cure and this by that i prove    love s fire heats water  water cools not love                    the end'"
